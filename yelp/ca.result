{"title": "div itemprop=\"review\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Review\">\n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Street parking and a small parking lot nearby, otherwise can be difficult to find parking if you come during night bar hop times.\n\nHowever, this bar may have one of the best values in terms of experience, price, food and beer in the area!\n\nFirst off, they have happy hour every day of the week before 7pm.  Beer selection isn&#39;t huge but they do have great choices in addition to typical domestics like bud and coors light.  I will mention that they were serving 10-12 dollar pitchers of coors if that is your drink.\n\nThey have great finger foods for decent prices (~6-10).  Best part is that the value on the food and drinks is great and will definitely fill you if you haven&#39;t eaten.  More importantly, if you order a 2-3 appetizers, they will definitely last you a whole game and drinks after.\n\nI will also note that they had a groupon deal as well, but I would go even if they didn&#39;t have it!\nThis place even has outlets to charge phones on almost each table! Tried and true food, innovative atmosphere and an accessible beer menu makes this place a must go for sports night!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Service was great, the venue is clean and spacious.  Glad to have a sports bar in the neighborhood that doesn&#39;t look at all dark and stinky.  \n\nHowever, I think we over ordered on too much fried food that I probably had constipation that night.\n\nThe totchos weren&#39;t that memorable and the wings seemed dry to me or maybe I envisioned it slathered in BBQ sauce.  The trio of sauces they brought out didn&#39;t blow me away.  My friend ordered a veggie burger and all she said was that &#34;it was ok.&#34;\n\nI still haven&#39;t given up and will give it another shot.  Perhaps order a full entre the next time.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        One of my friends was telling me about a new bar that just opened up in my neighborhood. We finally decided to check it out on Thursday, April 13th around 7pm. My group of four was seated at a booth in the back right. We had our own TV. There was a $29 Groupon for $50 Value for Food and Drinks, so I bought it that earlier that day.\n\n*Overtime Naked Wings: secret crispy recipe with three dipping sauces ($9)\n*Habanero Garlic Cream Chicken Strips: crispy chicken breast with fries ($9)\n*Parmesan Coated Lobster Cheese Bites: bitesize lobster cheesy delight ($12)\n*Fire Grilled Skirt Steak with Rosemary Mashed Potatoes: USDA steak with house spices ($16)\n*Zesty Lemon Salmon with Garlic Mashed Cauliflower: citrus glaze, roasted seasonal veggies ($15)\n*Ketel One ($9) and Pineapple (+$1)\n*Jameson ($8) \u00d73\n*Bulliet Rye ($9)\n*Drakes 1500 ($6)\n*Coors Light ($5) \u00d72\n*Bulliet Bourbon ($9): Old Fashioned (+$1)\n\nThe food here is priced very reasonably. Especially the entrees. The lobster bites were good. Very cheesy and comforting. And I love chicken wings, so these were up my alley. I also liked the three dips. I enjoyed the steak dish, but I found it a overcooked for medium rare. My focus here was drinking anyways, so I was more about all the rounds of Jameson on the rocks and Coors Light. They do have a happy hour here, but we had just missed it as I think it ended at 7pm.\n\nOvertime would be a great place to go for HH and watch a game. I hear they also do an oyster HH which I would adore. I will be back!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        This trendy new sports bar is a few months old and a fresh new addition the the inner Richmond-Geary bar scene.  They have a nice, new, clean atmosphere and of course with plenty of flat screens for game time.  \n\nStaff is friendly.  Beer selection is decent.  Cocktail and wine menu also adding a twist to sports bar.  Wed is half priced wine bottles so don&#39;t be surprised to see plenty of dubs fans watching the game sipping on wine rather than beer.  \n\nHappy hour here is another plus.  $1-$2 off drinks and $2 off grub menu with robust food portions.  \n\nDefinite must for the next sporting event.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Hope this new spot does well. \n\nIt&#39;s pretty spacious and light inside - lots of white and high ceilings. Big windows at the front. Very modern feeling. Flat screen TVs abound.\n\nThey have yelp check in deals during local games. \n\nTater Tots were nice and crispy (and free due to yelp check-in. Although the manager had to come verify the discount - seems like they could probably trust their servers enough to do that). Sauces were good. Chipotle was the best. The Ranch was SPICY!\n\nParmesan Coated Lobster Cheese Bites were quite nice. You could definitely actually taste the crab and they were nice and crispy. I&#39;m sure they have about a billion calories. ;)\n\nKale Caesar with grilled chicken was solid. I always want more kale and less romaine. The chicken was actually really tender. For my tastes I would have gone with a smidge more dressing (I like my dressing!).\n\nVeggie Burger was large and flavorful and came with a lot of fries. The coleslaw was very mayonnaisey (and therefore delicious IMO), but not inventive.  \n\nThe cost of the food is more than you want it to be at a sports bar, but it was high quality food, so it makes sense, but I can see it being hard for a sports bar crowd.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Let&#39;s Go Warriors!!! This sports bar was packed with fans for a warriors playoff game.  The decor is trendy, and the cocktails are strong and delicious.  I especially liked the Orange Crush and Pink Jersey drinks!! It does get a little busy and they had 2 bartenders, so waiting for a drink took a bit longer but the quality of the drinks made up for it.  I mostly went for the atmosphere and drinks, but did try the tots and will be getting them the next time I get there!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        y&#39;all gon ate me erthang fried overtime! overtime!\ny&#39;all gon ate me dine all out overtime! overtime!\ny&#39;all gon ate me snack a full overtime! overtime!\ny&#39;all gon ate me 4top booth overtime! overtime!\n\nunghhh dmx had us wilinout at our school basketball games. busta rhymes x mystikal was bumpin in math class. and buju banton was that other class with the ffffn photosynthesis charts.\n\nyes this place is so bright n so clean clean. yes it&#39;s a sports bar. deal with it.\n\n(^_^) Overtime Tater Tots $6 (http://bit.ly/2nGVTJA)\n+$3 &#34;tot-cho it!&#34; bacon, cheese, scallions, sour cream\nalways totchos never plain tots trick\n\n(-_^) Chicken Strips $9 (http://bit.ly/2muMJyH)\nthin dry meat but fun sauces #twss\n\n(-_^) Lobster Cheese Bites $12 (http://bit.ly/2mLdErM)\nparmesan overload (not complaining)\n\ntvs (and electric outlets!) at every gyatdaynm booth plus bunches more all around the walls &amp; bizzar. playing different channels so if ydgaf about one sport just look over at another one.\n\nrounding up to 4 stars bc okish food but &#34;fun factor&#34; of imaginative dishes mixnmatch beer + shot specials etc\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Hell yeah, finally a sports bar in the hood!\n\nThis place is great. Bright, clean and spacious. A TON of TV&#39;s. Each booth had it&#39;s own TV which I thought was pretty cool. If you grab one of the booths then you essentially get to pick what game you wanna watch. The bartender (Vee) was awesome. Super friendly and engaging. \n\nThe food was average. My salad was fine but nothing out of this world. The fries were solid. I&#39;m super stoked that they&#39;ll have a weekend brunch menu soon. Accompanied with bottomless mimosas YAY! \n\nTheir happy hour deals were great and I love that they have happy hour on the weekend! They have a ton of outlets on the back wall near the bar specifically for charging your phone, each booth had it&#39;s own outlet as well. So cool and smart that they did that. I haven&#39;t seen this anywhere else. \n\nMy only complaint is there are only 2 unisex bathrooms. Which I think could be a big problem on a busy Saturday night. Nonetheless, I&#39;m really excited this place opened up and can&#39;t wait to come back!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        I support this place! It may be fried food, and funny cereal and waffle ideas for brunch...which is creative, but its straight up bar food.  Realistically, it&#39;s a fantastic place to watch a game with lots of friends, eat some fried ass food, and drink good decently priced drinks! The service was great. Seemed a bit short handed but handled well. I will go back, and try new things and try new drinks. They&#39;re also open late, and who\nDoesn&#39;t like a plate of tots.....smothered in anything?\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Great new addition to the neighborhood, clean and large space for events and good food and delicious beers on drafts. Excited to see what they introduce next in the space! #cheers\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        **2ND EDIT: Management contacted me on Yelp and apologized for the facebook harrasment incident and has done everything they can to make it right. Proactive and considerate responses like that are super encouraging and can really go a looong ways to correct a bad experience. Based on the attitude that I see coming from management I&#39;m giving them back a couple stars and I&#39;m willing to give this place another shot. If the return visit ends up being a success I&#39;ll have no qualms doing yet another review and upping them to 4 or 5 stars. END EDIT**\n\n*EDIT: Employee used my receipt information and stalked me on Facebook to send me a hate message berating me for tipping a whole $0.75 less than the recommended amount. That&#39;s pretty creepy and shows a wanton lack of professionalism. Changing my review to the lowest it can go. END EDIT*\n\nMajor ding for poor service.\n\nThe Bad: Unsmiling and unfriendly bartender(s) serve a limited selection of beers and pour foamy draughts &amp; tiny wine glasses.\n\nThe Good: Clean and bright with plenty of TVs. Overall a good atmosphere for a sports bar. Looked like the food menu might have been good but we were so turned off by the service that we didn&#39;t stay to try anything. \n\nWas really hoping to like this place because it&#39;s right next to home... But with service like that we won&#39;t be returning. I&#39;ll forgive a great many sins for friendly and courteous service... This place just had it backwards.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        First time here and really impressed overall (menu, full bar, tv&#39;s located every where, awesome ambience, spacious layout, friendly customer service) \n\nFor a sports bar, their food is high-end quality. The only reason why I&#39;m writing this review, is to talk about their steak. Haven&#39;t had steak this good in awhile and honestly could&#39;ve had a 2nd plate. The portion size is perfect and does not make you feel overly stuffed. \n\nThey&#39;re coming out with a brunch menu soon; bottomless mimosas, etc.\n\nI hope this sports bar a continued success and a mainstay in the Inner Richmond.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        New and welcome addition to the Inner Richmond hood.\n\nGreat beer on tap, solid happy hour specials and the food is ON POINT!\n\nDon&#39;t miss it, they are clean, modern, new and Yuuuge TVs. Definitely the place to watch any game!\n\nI&#39;ll be back...Again...And again!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Has potential but have been in twice now and both times horrible music was playing instead of the games they were showing. Even during 1st round of NCAA playoffs they decided to play Secret Garden from Bruce Springsteen. What???? Asked the bartender and he said only if the warriors were playing would they play the sound. Ugh just another sports bar in SF that just doesn&#39;t quite understand the concept.\n\nNice and clean and bright and shiny! Haven&#39;t tried the food as we couldn&#39;t stay too long either time as the music was making us sleepy but the drinks were ok. Maybe will try again in a few months.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Stopped by to catch a Warriors game and ended up finding my new favorite hangout in the Richmond (RIP Buckshot). Clean yet has personality, and the amount of TVs and outlets to charge your phone is enough to make any tech friendly person love this place.\n\nThe food definitely justifies the restaurant title as it is a lot better than other &#34;bar food&#34; around the area. The loaded tots were perfect game food and the unique options made me want to keep coming back. Other suggestions: pork belly tacos and spicy mango chorizo sliders :)\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Great addition to the area, and conveniently located next to a MUNI stop!  Very nice looking bar in the inside. Huge &amp; great quality TVs at the bar top.  Happy hour grub is awesome, and if you check-in on Yelp, you receive a complimentary tater tots order!  The food menu has good appetizers, and even oysters which all are reasonably priced.  Haven&#39;t tried any entrees yet, but I&#39;ll be back to try.   Service at the bar is really good, for the bartenders have a great attitude.  My go-to place to watch several sports games simultaneously.  Good job to ownership\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        This place is pretty freggin great!\n\nTons of huge TV&#39;s showing any sports game you could possibly want. Tons of delicious food (you have to try the tots!) and a great selection of beer and cocktails. I have noticed that SF has a lot of divey sports bars and this is definitely not that (in the best way possible). It&#39;s clean and lively with modern TV&#39;s and food you won&#39;t feel bad about and some you will, but you won&#39;t care anyways ;)\n\nWe definitely needed this in the Richmond :) Welcome to the neighborhood Overtime! \n\nI&#39;ve been a few times and had different menu items - I can honestly say I haven&#39;t had one I didn&#39;t like but here are some of my favorites just in case you were looking for somewhere to start: \n\nTots - I know this is the second time I mentioned it, so you should order them. They are doing a special right now and if you check in and order a beer you get them for FREE!\n\nPork Belly Entree (the appetizer tacos are good too)\n\nCrispy Chicken Leg\n\nFish and Chips\n\nCeasar Salad\n\nClam Chowder\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Baby/toddler friendly.

{"title": "div itemprop=\"review\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Review\">\n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        I&#39;ve been disappointed with many of the Italian restaurants in the SF Bay Area. I so fondly remember the delicious food in Rome and in several cities in Sicilia. \n\nThat said we both wanted Italian food. And it is hard to find a place where I can eat much - I&#39;m vegetarian and try to avoid dairy and white flour/grains, sugar. So goodbye pasta, gnocchi with Gorgonzola sauce, pumpkin ravioli with brown butter, etc., etc.\n\nSo, we gave the restaurant a shot. I was resigned to thinking I&#39;d just have some salad and a side vegetable. But, they had a WHOLE WHEAT pasta primavera. It was great. The pasta actually tasted good and the marinara was excellent. The vegetables were well cooked and plentiful- just the way I make it myself. Full of mushrooms, eggplant, broccolini, kale and zucchini. My wife loved her chicken Marsala with a side of farro. She said the sauce was great and it wasn&#39;t too salty. \n\nThe started is off with complimentary focaccia with a tomato dip. I just tasted a tiny bit and both were wonderful. We got a side of Caesar and that was fantastic. So was the side of Brussels Sprouts \n\nAll in all a great dining experience.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        I could write a 5-star review on the smells alone.  We knew as soon as we walked through the door, that our meal would be outstanding.  \n\nClue number two that the food was going to be real and delicious: they served complimentary focaccia that both tasted good on its own and was a perfect vehicle for the most amazing tomato spread I&#39;ve ever had.  The focaccia was buoyantly fresh (not oily) and the crust was crispy.  They must have used slightly dried tomatoes for the spread or I don&#39;t know how they got summer tomato taste on May 1. \n\nSlightly dried tomatoes were definitely in the fantastic pasta primavera sauce that my spouse got.  This pasta was whole wheat, mind you, which usually tastes awful to me but was actively good and loaded with fresh seasonal vegetables.  I got chicken Marsala which was absolutely perfect and chose farro as a side.  On a scale of 1-10, this farro was a 45 billion.  \n\nI love that the food was not over-salted so we could taste ingredient purity and freshness.  All sauces were exquisitely flavorful and the sauce amount was perfect --- generous but not drowning.  This reminded me so much of delicious food we had in Italy.  \n\nThanks to the cooks.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Took my daughter and her friends there and as usual received a warm welcome at the door till we got to our table. \nMy daughter was visiting from NY and coming from there one should know a lot about Italian food and on the top of she is vegetarian but she ordered Caprese and Gamberi. Warm fresh bread from oven was served with fresh tomatoes paste/olive oil which is very delicious and everyone loved it.\nService was amazing our server Jennifer was very kind and understanding between veg and non veg group of people.\nAfter trying appetizer everyone got comfortable with the menu and we start ordering all kind a stuff cuz now we knew it it will be yummy. This was my 3rd trip to VIXI and I am so happy I took my family there. We all left happy and of course very full\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Came here today for a late lunch with my boyfriend and had a great experience. Seated quickly, got our order in and our food came quick. The food was really good. Both mine and my boyfriends dishes were delicious, we ordered The cavatappi and the penne gamberi\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        After a day of hiking with Gina M., we were both beyond starving. In an area that&#39;s full of sandwich shops, pizza parlors, and Asian restaurants, it was nice to spot Vixi on my trusty Yelp app. Parking was actually very easy to obtain, and just a short few steps from the restaurant. The inside is small, but cozy. I am a big fan of the kitchen being open, so you can watch the cooks prepare food. I think it&#39;s a nice touch that more restaurants should have. We sat in the back, and about a minute after being seated our bread with olive oil arrived. \n\nThe bread was tasty and hot, and the olive oil had a little tomato tapenade in it. The whole thing was quite good, and a great prelude for deliciousness to come. I ordered the Lemon Pepper Chicken, and for my one side I ordered broccolini. The chicken was fantastic. It was both cooked and seasoned perfectly. The broccolini was my favorite part of the meal. It had a very vibrant green hue, and it was mixed with big chunks of garlic, and tossed with pepper flakes. The whole meal just pops out at you. \n\nAs we waited for our meal, I witnessed the most bizarre and blasphemous thing to ever happen to Italian cuisine: An Italian woman and her children, asked for ketchup to slather their pasta and pizza with. I couldn&#39;t look away. I know I&#39;m no chef, but in my mind, you use ketchup like you use steak sauce: to slather on something that was not cooked or seasoned right. It just seemed like an insult to the chef, and I was a little shocked. \n\nVixi feels like a fancy, Italian restaurant, without the overpriced menu items. They have beautiful local art on the walls, and the wait staff wear shirts with bowtie pasta as bowties, which is too cute. I love this place, and I highly recommend it for anyone any the area looking for taste of Italy.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        For a log time this used to be a Pasta Pomodoro location. I was a fan of that model, as it provided fast, decent Italian food at good value. Pane Vino was not, but it was pretty good stuff, plus it was a short distance from our house, so I was bummed when it shut down.\n\nIn came Vixi, and it was a welcome addition to the neighborhood.  I was thrilled when I stopped there for a quick lunch at the counter. I had the shrimp appetizer, which comes with scrumptious sauce, and toasted, crunchy Italian bread to dunk in it. Yum!\n\nI had the salmon pasta, and it was surprisingly fresh and good. The wine list is simple but to the point, and I washed everything down with a couple of glasses of white wine.\n\nThe staff was pleasant and attentive. I will come back.\n\nIf you want solid, casual, Italian food in Laurel Heights-Presidio Heights-Inner Richmond, go here.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Really good Italian at a reasonable price point.\n\nI came in to grab some takeout for my mom.  It was during that quiet (&amp; usually awkward) time in between lunch &amp; dinner.  \n\nBut the host (maybe manager) could not have been nicer.\n\nI went w the salmone pasta.  Whole grain fusilli pasta in light tomato sauce w salmon.\n\nThe rock star host asked me &#34;green salad or Caesar salad?&#34;\n\nWhat a surprise.  I said Caesar.\n\n&#34;How about some bread?&#34;\n\n&#34;Sure,&#34; I answered w a shrug, thinking that this &amp; the Caesar were going to obviously cost extra.\n\nBut, it&#39;s for mom.  She&#39;s worth it.\n\nSurprise surprise...\nThey didn&#39;t cost extra!\n\nWhen my order was ready, which was only 15 minutes or so, the host did refer to me as &#34;young lady.&#34;  This only succeeded in scoring even more points for him.  \nIt is that easy.\n\nFresh &amp; flavorful.  The side Caesar could be a small meal all by itself.  And the bread is fresh focaccia bread, instead of the usual, borderline stale, baguette variety.  AND, it&#39;s served w a tomato tapenade for dipping.\n\nAll this for just 13 bucks?!\n\nMom was very happy.\nSo I was very happy.\n\nGreat spot for quick, casual, quality Italian.  \nGreat service.\n\n4 stars.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        This is the perfect restaurant for where it is located and who is therefore likely to frequent it: local hospital and Laurel Village employees, and families. This is a group of customers who need fast, tasty, reasonably healthy and affordable food. \n\nMy husband and I used to hold our noses and cover our eyes when we took our son to this old Pasta Pomodoro, which he loved. I nearly had a coronary when it suddenly shut down, because though it was never &#34;good,&#34; it was a satisfying choice in other ways. When Vixi first opened, I was confused. Is this just Pasta Pomodoro with a new name? Are these the same owners? Different owners? But I have to say, since trying it, I have been consistently pleased by the efficiency and quality of the food. It definitely fills the void of &#34;decent place I can take my kid that feels like an actual restaurant but doesn&#39;t come with the hassle of mega waits and slow service.&#34; \n\nEveryone who works there is always super friendly. They&#39;re probably not earning huge tips, yet they go out of their way to make sure you have everything you need at all times, and are very patient with little ones. \n\nI really hope this one lasts!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Nice family Italian good for lunch place. Service was friendly and food fresh and varied. Enjoyed cioppino, ravioli in pomodoro.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Since I first came to this location when Pasta Pomodoro opened (maybe I&#39;m dating myself), I was skeptical about this new restaurant which took over the space that had been occupied by Pasta Pomodoro for so long.\n\nThey have impressed me.\n\nI want to send an extra special shoutout to Eric, the manager, as last week he took care of me after they made a mistake with my takeout order. Thank you so much Eric, people with your level of customer service are the ones that keep me coming back to businesses for more.\n\nIn terms of the food, I especially love the gamberi (appetizer as well as the pasta dish), the cavatappi and the funghi pastas. My friend and I also agreed that the sun-dried tomato sauce that came with the bread was fantastic. \n\nVixi seems like a similar concept restaurant to pasta pomodoro, but with better quality ingredients as well as better service.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Another loving review for this Italian delight!! So i haven&#39;t actually been here but it is my\nGo-To spot on Postmates and Uber Eats. The salmon and chicken parm are delicious. Healthy and sides are food. Also you would be remissed if you didn&#39;t get a kiddie size lasagne -\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Really good value! I brought my stroller and an annoying baby and they were only nice! Glasses of wine come with cute mini carafe: good amount and good vino!\n\nThe menu reminds me of pasta pomodoro, but I prefer it now. I have to say the chicken I added to my pasta was dry, so maybe skip that... But the Caesar salad that came w my lunch meal: awesome. I liked the cheese! Flecked with pepper.also the bread and dip: amazing. Maybe it&#39;s out of season but I was looking for a pumpkin ravioli w sage. I hope their menu incorporates something like this soon!\n\nMum mum! I say softly while the baby sleeps.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        This has to be the best Italian restaurant in San Francisco! Our server, Jennifer, was very attentive and helpful. Her recommendation of the chicken parmigiana and the spinach ravioli was the best food I&#39;ve had and the owner Zeeshan was on site and an absolute delight to converse with! I will definitely be coming back again and again.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Love this place. This is my go to for affordable Italian and I&#39;m not just saying this because I live around the corner.  I use to drive here all the time when I resided in Chinatown. That&#39;s how much I appreciate their service.\n\nBest thing on the menu is fettucine funghi and the pasta dish with creamy tomato sauce. I forget the name but I&#39;ve just about tried everything on the menu\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        I visited this place with my mom, grandma, wife and two young boys.  The food was delicious.  I tried the Minestrone soup, lasagna, a salad with warm vegies, the kids pizza, a pasta with seafood and a coke to wash it down.  I didn&#39;t eat this all by myself.  We shared.\n\nThe food was delicious.  All of it.  Super good and the restaurant itself is well decorated and inviting.  The only reason why I can&#39;t give 5 stars is because the waiter was just so so.  He wasn&#39;t rude but he wasn&#39;t cheerful either.  He just seemed to be not in the mood to be there.  We all have those days though so I don&#39;t want it to discourage anyone.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Great prices and delicious food. My favorite all-around Italian restaurant in the city!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Delicious delicious delicious! Very attentive staff as well, will come again! \n\nEnjoyed the clams with tomato sauce, brussel sprouts and lasagna.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        We practically live in the hospital next door. So I&#39;ve been eating here a lot. To the owner, who I think I saw pacing the floor last night when I picked up my pizza (my $10 amazing delicious gourmet pizza which has to be a loss leader), I think you need to do more incentivization of the hospital staff. Give them some amazing discount for 6 months then drop it to something more modest, then something sustainable after about a year. Just realize that the Starbucks next door is open 24 hours because that one resource drives enough traffic to sustain them. It&#39;s not the staff that is going to make you so full that people are waiting in line outside (showing the world how great your restaurant is), it&#39;s all of us, the patient&#39;s families, they will recommend you to who will make the difference. This place needs to be packed out the door. Once you can&#39;t hold another human being inside of the building, then you can worry about pricing up to curb the demand and enjoy the spoils. And you can expand. Look at Super Duper Burger. Keep it consistent and keep it awesome. You&#39;re off to a great start.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        I love this little Italian place and the food is way better than the chain that used to be there before. After coming back from Italy this summer I was craving a good Italian meal that tasted authentic. This hit the spot. You can tell the owner cares a lot about this place and I often see him there. The staff is really sweet and hard working to serve you a quality meal at a decent price.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        I went there with a friend and it was a really good place their appetizers was awesome I got a shrimp with tomato sauce I felt my self in Italy back on time :) after the entre was a Fruti di Maree wow it was the really tasty , the stuff there were very friendly and nice they check on you every 5 mins for refills really liked the place thanks guys .\n    \n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        \n\n            \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            Vixi Cucina Italiana", "url": "/biz/vixi-cucina-italiana-san-francisco", "hours": "Mon                    11:00 am - 9:00 pm                                                                Tue                    11:00 am - 9:00 pm                                                                                Wed                    11:00 am - 9:00 pm                                                                Thu                    11:00 am - 9:00 pm                                                                Fri                    11:00 am - 9:30 pm                                                                Sat                    11:00 am - 9:30 pm                                                                Sun                    11:00 am - 9:00 pm", "tele": "(415) 842-4921", "address": "3611 California StSan Francisco, CA 94118", "imageList": ["https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DS1C-h9W890tCUH_m3PHxA/ls.jpg", "c0e7a1ce726fce60f848fb43ffc6d1d1.jpg"], "type": "Italian,\n                    Pasta Shops"}

{"title": "div itemprop=\"review\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Review\">\n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        My experience was one where I was satisfied, sort of got exactly what I was looking for (seafood!), but I just wasn&#39;t blown out of the water (lol!). We were looking for some crab but foolishly thought it would be available. Little did we know the wild crabs are mating so their sex is not to be disturbed just so humans could eat their bodies.\n\nWe had:\n1) Clam chowder bowl--very creamy and delicious!\n2) Fish and chips--perfectly flaky batter with tender/juicy fish meat on top of a bed of fries that were a little above average.\n3) Lobster roll--not the best ever, but gets the job done if you&#39;re looking for that succulent lobster meat sitting between some buttery sourdough bread. The buttery lobster taste could&#39;ve been more apparent and not as drowned out by the celery/mayo sauce.\n\nI guess after eating seafood around the world, in my opinion this place just didn&#39;t have that oomph that makes it stand out from the rest. Everything was good, but won&#39;t be the best. If anything, this is a great place to take a date to enjoy the interior design, the area around Japantown, some good seafood paired with an SF brew.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        I gotta tell ya, I&#39;m a big fan of woodhouse fish co. Any establishment that knows how to make amazing lobster rolls, cioppino and fish &amp; chips gets a five star rating. Is it a little pricey? Yes. Do you have to pay up to get great seafood? Yes. \n\nLast week I finally ordered something other than the lobster roll and it was really hard to break away from tradition. Instead, I got the cioppino and it was delicious! Piled high with amazing scallops, clams, crab, muscles, etc. there&#39;s no shortage of seafood. The broth is flavorful and the pesto garlic bread is a perfect accompaniment. \n\nWoodhouse. Thanks for existing. :)\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        I am all for high quality food being priced  as such. But while the lobster roll here was pretty good, it took overpriced to a whole new level!\n\nMy friend is super in love with all things lobster so naturally I suggested we split a large order of the lobster roll ($26). \n\nWhile I didn&#39;t expect it to be ginormous in size, we were both a bit surprised at just how small a large order was when brought out. The whole roll was smaller than my hand and I have the world&#39;s tiniest hands! But while the actual bread roll was small, they definitely did not skimp on the lobster, as there were huge lobster chunks literally spilling off the bread roll. Which is strange cause how much more could it possibly cost to just use bigger bread rolls?! \n\nThe roll also came with some french fries (average, typical fries) and a small bit of cole slaw. We did enjoy the lobster chunks on our lobster roll and thought the lobster was really fresh, but just could not get over the sizing of the bread roll.\n\nIf you are craving a lobster roll, this did a solid job, but for me, it just wasn&#39;t worth the $30 price-tag for a less than filling portion size.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        I was yelping around for somewhere to eat for an early dinner. I mentioned this restaurant to my friend and she said this was one of her favorite places to have seafood.\n\nThe hardest thing was choosing what to order. I was told to order the fish and chips, but I also wanted to try the clam chowder. So we ordered a 3 piece order of the fish and chips and a cup of the clam chowder. We also order the garlic bread because we wanted to have a little sample of it.\n\nSo the portions are very filling here. I could have had the 2 piece order and still not finished it. You could tell that the fish was fresh and they had a nice batter. The fries were nice and crispy.  I couldn&#39;t stop nibbling on them even when I was full. The clam chowder was amazing. It had huge chunks of clam and a nice amount of garlic. Order through side of garlic bread. It&#39;s not on the menu, but you can order it if you ask for it.\n\nI came in around 5 pm which was perfect for me to get my food quickly and get home. Will definitely be back when I&#39;m in San Francisco.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Excellent! Excellent! Excellent! Oyster were fresh and delicious. Crab in butter sammy was all crab and delicious as well. Location is small although it is worth the wait. Service was very good, I think the bus person was the hardest worker in the joint as he was the one who made sure our water was filled and table cleared. Kudos to him.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        I felt like the food was really expensive for what it was and the food wasn&#39;t even that good. I think the best thing we had here were the fries and that says something about the rest of the food. I was really disappointed because this place had really good reviews and it looked really cute and promising. I&#39;ve definitely had better lobster rolls for much cheaper. Same with the chowder. This place is ridiculously overpriced and because the food was only decent I don&#39;t think it&#39;s really worth it.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        My friend found this place on Yelp after we were craving some oysters and had trekked all the way to Swan Oyster Depot, only to find out it was closed on Sundays.\n\nSo we came in at around 4 pm and the place wasn&#39;t too filled up (probably because it was a weird time to eat). We were seated immediately and ordered some oysters, clam chowder, and a lobster roll - all to share. Again, since it was a weird time to be eating and we hadn&#39;t had lunch yet, we also didn&#39;t want to be too full since we were still planning to have dinner later.\n\nThe oysters were okay - nothing to write home about. Nothing you can&#39;t get for a dollar in NYC. But then again, I can&#39;t really tell the difference between most oysters; just that it&#39;s saltier and/or plumper. The clam chowder was pretty good. As for the lobster roll, this was again just okay. The cole slaw that it came with had way too much mayo.\n\nOverall, I would say that Woodhouse is an okay choice if you&#39;re in the area. But if you&#39;re willing to travel, I&#39;m sure there are better places in SF.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Came here with my boyfriend around 8pm on a Friday night and we were seated immediately! I expected a wait so this was a wonderful surprise. We decided to order a small lobster roll ($22) and a large lobster roll ($36) to split. We felt ordering two smalls would not give us enough lobster meat and two larges would be too much but also too pricey. In addition, we had the hefeweizen and the ipa, both were great but we both loved the ipa alot more. \n\nThe lobster rolls were amazing! I definitely had my lobster craving satisfied but I wouldn&#39;t have if we had only gotten small rolls. They use the same size rolls for both and the only difference is that there&#39;s double meat on the large. What we did was we each took half a small and half a large and split the meat evenly over both rolls. Therefore, we each ended up with a lobster roll containing around 4.5 ounces of meat...and boy oh boy was the meat good! The lobster tasted so fresh and juicy and despite it having some mayo sauce on it, the flavor was not masked by it. It was by far the best lobster roll I have ever had (here on the west coast, since I have not yet tried east coast rolls so its unfair to compare). In addition, the coleslaw was refreshing and creamy and the fries were a great compliment. \n\nI totally recommend this place for the lobster rolls. Its pretty damn pricey but its totally worth!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Yum! Lenten Fridays for the win :) Woodhouse Fish Co. was a 10-15 min wait for 4 of us at primetime last Friday. The food was delicious, fresh, and quick. The shared steamed clam appetizer is a great group starter (we got two!) and all the mains were pretty delicious.\n\nBeing from Maryland, I wasn&#39;t completely taken by their crabcake. It did seem to have a lot of breadcrumbs, and not as much crabmeat as it should have. Next time, I&#39;ll just straight up order the crab.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Amazing Italian dishes with a San Francisco spin on it! \n\nFish and chips- Go for the 3 pieces option, the fish is amazing! The batter is light and cripsy, and the fish was fresh, juicy and tender. There is no rubbery texture to the fish, it was on point. Fries on the side were great as well, crispy and slightly salted. Simple ingredients, high quality, and excellent execution. Who knew a simple dish can be this delicious? \n\nCioppino- I took a sip of the tomato broth, and my smile went ear to ear. The broth tastes very strongly of tomato, but what I like most is the natural sweetness of the tomato, it was SO delicious. I dip the garlic break into the broth, but I could not remember much about the bread because my taste buds where dancing to the tomato base. I will be content just with the broth without the seafood. There are crab, mussel, clams, shrimp, etc, an actual feast of seafood! All items were fresh and had the taste from the ocean. So fresh, so good. My favorite dish by far, with such an amazing broth with a variety of fresh seafood!\n\nThe restaurant is quite small, so expect a wait. Decoration is beautiful, I find myself looking at the ships models and ocean mural on the wall a lot. Staff were friendly and efficient. Great dining experience, I will definitely be back!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Whether you are a New Englander homesick for seafood that&#39;s not poke (which is essentially on every corner) or a San Franciscan trying to look sophisticated, Woodhouse Fish Co. is an SF staple for cioppino, clam chowder, fish n chips, and lobsta rolls P:\n\nTo start off with the elephant in the room: How does the lobster roll compare to Boston? \nObviously, there&#39;s no comparison--the lobster wasn&#39;t as fresh and tasted relatively more bland, as if it had been frozen and shipped across the country (which is literally the case, if it&#39;s truly Maine lobster), the flavor was overcompensated by the mayo so it turned out very creamy, and the roll could have used a tad bit more butter for a more brioche-y profile. The coleslaw was tiny (and also excessively creamy), placed in what is usually the size of a sauce cup. The fries turned out quite perfectly: warm but not too hot, with a satisfying crisp. \n\nThe $22/small (3 oz) is a decently filling portion size, especially since you get stuffed with fries. After tax/tip/SF mandate it totals closer to $28. The menu price is similar to New England Eatery ($23.50) in Burlingame, the other lobsta roll eatery in the Bay. \n\nService is friendly, and the vibe of the restaurant is more of a traditional seafood restaurant, in contrast to the many hipster places in SF. It&#39;s a nice sit-down place that&#39;s good for taking your visiting friends (unless they are from the East Coast), since it doesn&#39;t get too loud and features a unique repertoire of seafood. They also have a specials board, on which I noticed a pork belly shrimp po-boy. \n\nThe verdict? Good SF option to satisfying lobsta roll cravings, but do not come with Boston-level expectations.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Came here for lunch the other day. I&#39;ve eaten their food before but only ordered to go. Decided it was time to sit down!\n\nI got the lobster roll, which is good but could have been less bland. I paired it with the Drakes Hefeweizen, which turned out nicely. The food is delicious, but for the price, I honestly expect a little bit more. My friend ordered the Arnold Palmer - it all comes I separate containers and you get to pick your ratio of lemonade (which looked amazing), iced tea, and simple syrup.\n\nThe service was good and we didn&#39;t have too long of a wait for the food. I would definitely come here again, maybe because I&#39;m too lazy to cook my own lobster.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Best hole in the wall place ever! Decided I wanted some good seafood, and found this place via Yelp. Absolutely amazing, and delicious. Ordered the clam chowder as well as the crab stuffed artichoke. Ended up leaving with a doggie bag and everyone was asking me what I had because it smelled so good. Wish there was a location in Dallas!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        My &#34;go to&#34; for some seafood in the city!\n\nI always find myself coming back to Woodhouse when I venture into the city. Not my first time here, but I decided to try something different and was so glad I did. I normally start with a cup of New England clam chowder, then get the fish n chips for my main course - so flaky and so good! This time, we started with a dozen oysters and I branched out and ordered the steamed clams for dinner. The garlic wine broth really made the entree, especially with the garlic bread for dipping! \n\nI am a big seafood person and love the consistency and freshness that Woodhouse offers. Although not in the most touristy neighborhood (which I like), I definitely recommend over anything offered at the infamous Fisherman&#39;s Wharf.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        We love this place!...Never had a bad meal here.  The clam chowder is exceptional, with lots of tender clams and bits of potato in a flavorful New England style (white) base.   \nTonight, we started with sharing a bowl of the chowder, then had a couple crabcake, and the whole Dungeness crab.  \nThe crab is served with either cold with lemon or steamed in a white wine, lemon, garlic butter sauce. THE WHITE WINE SAUCE IS A MUST, as is some bread to soak it up (which they will provide upon request).  The crab itself was very fresh and had an almost sweet flavor, and the portion was huge and all for a very reasonable price. We always leave here totally stuffed and satisfied, and we will be back!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        We stopped here to grab a lovely lunch in a cute little neighborhood on my first time visit to San Francisco - we had to try the Dungeoness crab and Cioppino \n\nThe place is nice and airy albeit a bit small but we sat at the bar which was comfortable.  With the name Woodhouse Fish Company I would&#39;ve expected it to be more of a loud  &#34;in the rough&#34; place but it&#39;s light, quiet  and sunny and the service was spot on.\n\nBoth meals were tasty however of the two I think I would just get their cioppino again - it was chock full of fish, mussels scallops and a healthy portion of the crab.  With my girlfriend getting a whole crab (it was quite a bit- a half size would have been fine) and me getting the cioppino we just had too much crab.  (never thought I&#39;d be saying that but yes, you CAN have too much crab) \n\nAll around it&#39;s a solid stop off to take in some of the local cuisine.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        I came here with my family (6 people) on the fly and we were seated within 40 minutes, which is pretty incredible on its own! \n\nComing from Seattle, we&#39;re all big seafood fans, and I must say we weren&#39;t disappointed. The portion sizes were great and the prices fit accordingly. My parents and brother really enjoyed their Hartford clam chowder, which is a mix of two-thirds New England and one-third Manhattan. I was pleased with the crab cakes, although they were a bit heavy on the bell pepper side. \n\nThe decor was fun and nautical. The rolling film on the kitchen-side wall was a nice touch and the photos of San Francisco from the fire up to the present were interesting. \n\nOverall, nothing particularly wowed or stuck out, but it was a nice restaurant with friendly service and tasty food, and somewhere I&#39;d go again.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        While in San Francisco a few weeks ago I was determined to find a good seafood place before the end of my trip. After a quick Yelp search Woodhouse seemed like the best option. I went here with some friends and was excited to hear that they had $1.00 oysters on Tuesdays.\n\nI got the lobster roll and half a dozen oysters. First off, the oysters were out of this world. They tasted so fresh and I couldn&#39;t have been happier. That is until I tried the lobster roll, and was blown away. It was so good. Toasted bread with a huge amount of lobster and a side of fries was plenty of food. \n\nIt&#39;s truly a shame that this place is so far away, but it left quite the impression on me. If you ever find yourself in San Francisco for any reason, you have to stop here. It&#39;s too great not to.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        I love this place! I&#39;ve been at least five times. I&#39;m from New England and have really high seafood expectations. This place meets them consistently. This is one of two places I&#39;ve been to in SF that has oysters I enjoy eating (I normally don&#39;t like West Coast oysters). The service is great, menu is great, food is great.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        The dinner decision for the evening was up to me, and I settled on Woodhouse because of the famous lobster rolls. You can&#39;t find them at too many places in Hawaii (at least, in sandwich form), so I was anxious to try the entr\u00e9e here. Plus, I was craving fresh lobster.\n\nWoodhouse doesn&#39;t take reservations, so our group of four showed up around 6:15 p.m. on a Saturday evening and were told the wait was 20-30 minutes. There are neighboring stores you can browse in while waiting for your name to be called. Just check back in with the hostess close to your time to make sure your entire party is present. \n\nThe restaurant isn&#39;t that big and seating is rather crowded, so if you have a larger party, it&#39;s a good idea to go early. I must say, even though Woodhouse was busy, their customer service was on point. One of our group member&#39;s entrees was super delayed in coming (the stuffed artichokes took a long time to prepare, I guess). But, to compensate for the long wait time, our server brought a huge bowl of soup for her and comped one of our beers. That was a nice gesture on the restaurant&#39;s behalf, but the food was delicious. It was worth waiting for.\n\nHere&#39;s what we ordered:\n\n&#34;Stuffed Artichokes&#34;: This was probably the most unique entr\u00e9e on our table. It featured split, grilled and stuffed artichokes that were filled with Dungeness crab and bay shrimp. I was impressed with the sheer size of this dish, as well as the fillings -- they didn&#39;t skimp on the crab or the shrimp. Even though this entr\u00e9e took a while to make, my friend said it was delicious and it was definitely different. It also comes with dipping sauces and garlic toast. \n\n&#34;Baja-Style Fish Tacos&#34;: This entr\u00e9e comprised crispy, battered cod with cabbage, chipotle aioli, pico de gallo and avocado. It featured three fish tacos. Having spent some time in San Diego, I feel like my standard for fish tacos is high ... but this dish really wowed me. Instead of being grilled, the fish was crispy. It was lightly battered and perfectly fresh; not too crispy, oily or greasy. My friend and I were pleasantly surprised by how much we enjoyed it! And, the tacos weren&#39;t puny - three per order was a good size. The chipotle aioli was also delicious; it added a nice kick to the tacos. If you&#39;re craving fish but don&#39;t want all the fries (from the fish and chips), I highly recommend giving this entr\u00e9e a try. \n\n&#34;Split-Top Maine Lobster Roll&#34;: You could get the smaller version for $22 or the larger version for $36. I was hungry by this time, but I opted for the smaller version because I didn&#39;t know how large the large actually was. The small ended up being the perfect size - the sandwich itself wasn&#39;t super duper big, so I was able to finish it all because I was starving. I had leftovers of the fries, which was fine. The sandwich itself was just as tasty as I imagined it to be - the bread was warm, buttery and slightly chewy, and I actually really liked the coleslaw. It was refreshing and tasty. The lobster chunks were juicy, fresh, buttery and flavorful. The fries are thin fries, and since I don&#39;t use ketchup, I coated them liberally with malt vinegar to give it added taste. Yum! I would recommend this lobster roll because it&#39;s worth trying if you haven&#39;t before and it hits the spot if you&#39;re craving it. But, go with the smaller option so you can perhaps try some of the other entrees your group orders. \n\n&#34;Cioppino&#34;: My friend wanted to compare this cioppino dish to others he had gotten in the past. This entr\u00e9e came with garlic bread and was deemed &#34;the grand San Francisco seafood dish.&#34; There was too much tomato for my personal preference in this dish, but it was a good seafood medley if you want things with shells (clams, mussels, etc.) in a hearty broth. \n\n&#34;Cheddar Cheese Crab Melt&#34;: I was thinking of ordering this or the lobster roll, since I really wanted a sandwich for dinner. But, since I knew I was going to get something with crab the next morning for brunch, I decided to pass on the crab cheese melt for dinner that evening. I read good things about it though, and I want to try it next time. It seems like this sandwich includes the same buttery bread that&#39;s used to make the lobster roll, and the sandwich itself comes generously stuffed with chunks of crab and lots of melted cheese. \n\n&#34;Fish and Chips&#34;: This was another entr\u00e9e I was debating on getting, since I love a good fish and chips and SF is known for their seafood. You have the option of getting two or three pieces. I would probably opt for two pieces if I ever order this dish. Now that I know the fish here really is phenomenal--and I like the way it&#39;s battered and prepared--I look forward to ordering this one day.\n    \n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        \n\n            \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            Woodhouse Fish Company", "url": "/biz/woodhouse-fish-company-san-francisco-3", "hours": "Mon                    11:30 am - 10:00 pm                                                                Tue                    11:30 am - 10:00 pm                                                                                Wed                    11:30 am - 10:00 pm                                                                Thu                    11:30 am - 10:00 pm                                                                Fri                    11:30 am - 10:30 pm                                                                Sat                    11:30 am - 10:30 pm                                                                Sun                    11:30 am - 10:00 pm", "tele": "(415) 437-2722", "address": "1914 Fillmore StSan Francisco, CA 94115", "imageList": ["https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/P9iwqvEv6Y0Xn0202FpCLA/ls.jpg", "65dc533e691f4cef3772f812645a8d98.jpg"], "type": "Seafood,\n                    American (New)"}

{"title": "div itemprop=\"review\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Review\">\n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Review is only for their weekday lunch time Shokado bento!\n\nFor $17, you are served so many delicious and well cooked goodies, including tempura, delicious sashimi (salmon and walu!), perfectly broiled fish, pickles, nimono (a simmered dish), miso soup, and of course, rice.\n\nIt didn&#39;t look like too much food to begin with, since all of the portions were pretty small, but it ended up being more than enough. Definitely a good bang for your buck, and so much more satisfying that the teriyaki chicken bento boxes you get at other places!\n\nwill be back for weekday lunch!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        The best part of our meal here probably was the friendly service. I loved that our waitress brought out a warm towel for our hands when we sat down but waited to bring out the other towels when the rest of our party arrived. \n\nBest thing we had were the hamachi carpaccio appetizer special (with avocado slices and a tasty cucumber and mango slaw) and the hamachi kama. The rolls we ordered were fine, but not spectacular and definitely smaller in size.  We enjoyed our dinner with cold house sake, which was smooth and delicious.\n\nFor dessert we tried the black sesame ice cream, but I found the black sesame flavor slightly lacking. Overall great service and ok food.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Tried the Omakase, the oyster/quail egg/uni shooters and anago for dinner and this place is good. The omakase is really fantastic value ($65) but it&#39;s not the traditional sushi Kaiseki that you would get from places like Kusakabe.  The highlights of the meal are the miso black cod, the anago, the shooters and the black sesame ice cream. \n\nService was outstanding and this is a really good upper end neighborhood sushi place. I&#39;m really glad I found it.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Delicious and fresh Japanese food. We ordered the preset sashimi plate that was $45 dollars with assorted sashimi, all tasted fatty and fresh. The oyster shooters were interesting, and there were strong Sake in it. I didn&#39;t like the cod appetizer, as it was not clear from the menu that it was going to be breaded and fried. I&#39;d prefer the miso baked kind.\n\nThe service could be better.\n\nThe servers had a difficult time to put the plates on the sushi bar, where we were sitting. They came with plates from behind, and we had to lean to the sides for them to insert the plates in between us. That was awkward for them and for us. They could have just serve us the food from where the sushi chefs were; from the front instead. Also, the servers do not take the plates as we finish them, therefore, as they bring the new plates out, they don&#39;t have place to put them. They never refilled our green tea. \n\nService could definitely be improved.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Simply sushi.\n\nHad an impromptu dinner here and I really enjoyed myself!  Given that everything was solid, I&#39;d say it&#39;s a solid 4-star experience.  Something is missing for me to dish out the &#34;5&#34; and I can&#39;t say exactly what.  Just chalk it up to ambiance.  But I would totally come back! \n\nFood - 5 stars\nLots of vegetarian options and as long as you mention that to them, they will make sure nothing comes out that includes meat or fish sauces.  That being said, I thought everything was super fresh, flavorful, and delicious.  I went for\n-Veggie Tempura\n-Avocado Roll\n-Pickled radish roll (I forgot what it&#39;s called but it was delish)\n-Warm filtered sake (Did I mention there&#39;s a bar?  You could totally trade the sake for a cocktail)\n\nService - 4\nHonestly, I think that service was pretty good given how new this place is.  Just small things I couldn&#39;t make a &#34;5&#34; - the guy spilled my sake and didn&#39;t offer a refill.  We had to ask for waters. My friend and I each ordered appetizers brought out mine out first, while he had to wait hella long for his. But seriously, none of these things impacted my experience too much.\n\nAmbiance - 4+\nIt&#39;s a pretty cool spot, not a ton of space, but lots of choices.  You could come in alone and sit at that cool bar, head in with with a date (as there&#39;s not a lot of noise going on), or with a super small group.  Either way, it&#39;s a pleasant experience.  And BTW, we walked right in on a Thursday night!\n\n***ONE LAST THING - This is smack dab on a busy street.  Parking around wasn&#39;t too bad on a Thursday night, but plan to circle a couple of times in this location*\n\nAll in all, sushi in a subdued ambiance, at a great value for your dollar!!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Service: 5*\nSushi: 3 * - 5 *\nAtmosphere: 4*\n\nThe scallop uni ankimo quail egg spoons deserve a special mention. The flavour is incredible. I think I could eat those all day long. That would be an expensive day though. In any case, in my opinion that&#39;s a 5* dish.\n\nOverall because of the service you will have an enjoyable experience here, if you are service-centric. Service always depends on who your server is, but ours was exceptional.\n\nIf you are food-centric, I found not all items on the menu are exceptional. Nothing is bad, but if you come here once and don&#39;t pick the right things you might be less impressed. There are a few dishes that really shine though.\n\nThere&#39;s a lot of sushi to explore in SF, but I wouldn&#39;t mind eating here again if the occasion presented itself! And it would be a way to have a few more of those ridiculously tasty ankimo spoons again sometime. Sometime soon.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Came here for an early dinner on Saturday night with two friends. We were in the mood for sushi before going to see a movie at AMC Van Ness (which is less than a 10-minute walk away). We loved all the food we got - we all had various sushi rolls, plus tofu and edamame. And the wine was pretty good. Very reasonably priced. \n\nThey do take reservations, and it seemed to be getting kind of crowded as we were leaving so it might be worth calling ahead.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        We got the omakase and also a few additional items because, we&#39;re just big eaters! The spoonful of happiness is delicious with uni, ankimo and oyster. The omakase was good, but we weren&#39;t satisfied with the nigiris. The flavors weren&#39;t there, the sushi rice wasn&#39;t flavored, the fish wasn&#39;t seasoned. I get that this is good value for $65 for omakase in the city, but there are definitely better sushi restaurants out there for nigiri if that&#39;s what you&#39;re looking for. We got a bottle of wine for 3 people and ended up about $120 a person with additional nigiris and the spoonful of happiness special. I think at that price, daigo and koo are much better. \n\nThis is a quick fast sushi joint that are probably better for with rolls and kaiseki style offerings.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        I had a yummy dinner at Akira on Friday. I called the day before to make a reservation for 2 at 8pm. When I first arrived, I was seated at the table closest to the door and when another party left, I asked to be moved since it was too cold to sit where the door opens and closes. Our server was friendly and helpful.\n\nWe got 3 rolls - Pink Dragon, Spicy Mango, and Seared Salmon Belly (on specials menu). We both agreed that the Pink Dragon (with shrimp tempura) was the best and the Spicy Mango was not as good as the other two. We also ordered Sake (salmon) nigiri, which was not as buttery as I like my salmon. In addition, we had the Miso Gindara; again it was good but I&#39;ve had better black cod at other Japanese restaurants. We also shared a bottle of Dassai Nigori sake. \n\nThe portion sizes were small. Somehow the rolls seemed tiny and the nigiri sushi was compact and the cod was mini-sized as well. For the same price point, you can get a lot more in terms of quality, quantity, creativity, and value at Elephant Sushi. Akira is good; there&#39;s just better out there.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Came here on a Saturday night to take a table for four around 930pm. Was glad that we could be accommodated, as I called earlier that evening to be told it was fully booked. \nThe place itself is not somewhere you would stumble upon, so thank god for Yelp. It&#39;s a very nicely decorated dining area, and there was a nice atmosphere. \nI have to say this is the best sushi I&#39;ve had in SF. And possibly ever. Everything we ordered was top notch and it&#39;s really good value. The bill for 4 including beers was only $160, and we had lots of dishes. \nThe stand out items are the grilled asparagus on the appetizer menu, and the pink dragon rolls on the special rolls menu. Also tried the tuna sashimi among others. \nThe reason for not giving 5 stars is the service was a little slow and not overly enthusiastic, and there is a very limited wine menu. \nOtherwise this place cannot be faulted.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Came here on Valentine&#39;s Day with my boo and we didn&#39;t know we needed reservations! But they were so nice and found a table for us. \nWe ordered the tori karage and miso soup as appetizers. Tasty, but i wish the karage came with a dip and not just lemon.\nWe ordered sake and unagi nigiri. The unagi was on point! I love eel. My boyfriend usually doesn&#39;t order eel but he loved it as well! We also ordered two rolls the cherry blossom and the other I don&#39;t recall the name. It was probably because it was on a side menu but it was something salmon belly? Anyways they were both really good &amp; fresh.\nFor dessert we ordered the sesame ice cream. Super savory!\nWe will return again. Great service and great food!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        New joint that I recently brought my girlfriend to because she loves Japanese food and we heard great things about this place. I think the service was great, our server was nice, spontaneous, and fun. The food was pretty good for the most part. We ordered the Omakase which was only $65 per person for 7 courses + Hokkaido uni quail egg with scallop and hamachi carpaccio with truffle oil, fruit sake, and plum wine. \n\nThe appetizers on the 7 course menu i could&#39;ve done without, they weren&#39;t great but doesn&#39;t add anything to the dish. I also didn&#39;t like the red miso soup that much. Apart from those 2, I liked everything else I had. The only gripe I have with this place is the 2 pieces of bones found in my girlfriends salmon nigiri. Not very pleasant. \n\nOther than that, this place is great, i&#39;d come back!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Eh it&#39;s okay.  Best part was probably the super nice staff (although I&#39;m not a fan of the waitress who when we tried to order a particular roll, told us we don&#39;t want that we should order this one one instead).  \n\nThis place is also super loud.  For us, it was like we were at a bar, so not the best place if you want to have any type of dinner conversation.\n\nIn terms of food, we got the sashimi platter, the tempura udon, anago tempura, and some roll that the waitress insisted we get.  The tempera was okay, but the shell wasn&#39;t that crispy, and the dipping sauce could have been saltier.  Overall the food is decent, not that great, and really not worth the wait out the door.  Save your time and money.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Very very ordinary / average Japanese restaurant. With such high rating on Yelp , I went in on a Valentine day with high expectation. \nNo wait at all and the restaurant are pretty empty . \n\nGot seated with the staff are friendly . \nThe menu selection wasn&#39;t big , there is a law of the lunch menu which can&#39;t be applicable for dinner. But on the Don and noodles section it did not specify it is for Lunch only . So I wanted to order the Unagi Don but the waiter said that Don/ noodles place are for lunch only . \n\nBig bummer ,  if Don and noodles are for lunch only then what else can we order besides nigiri , sashimi and appetizer . There is a $65 omakase included nigiri , dessert and appetizer but does not seems worth it so I didn&#39;t get that. \n\nSo I asked the waiter if I can get the chirashi don ($19) the most expensive Don on the menu and he said yes. Okay ... so .... he just said the Don are only for lunch but I can only order chirashi for tonight .... okay....  another skeptical part is , I asked what about the udon he said he need to ask the chief . So we ended up with a chirashi , a Kobe dragon and rainbow roll . Plus two pieces of Hokkaido scallops nigiri . \n\nOverall , the portion are really small , especially the chirashi .... very disappointing. The fishes are not fresh .... but i enjoyed the Kobe dragon roll ! \n\nThe Hokkaido scallop priced at $8 for two , don&#39;t order that .... it just taste super ordinary like the one you can buy on the street anywhere .\n\nA side note is ,Tea is $2 each , they did not tell me when I order them . \nI will probably not come back again , because of the quality is not fresh and it is just not worth a visit .tsubasa sushi are way better , on the same district .\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        I haven&#39;t found too many decent sushi places in SF, so Akira is definitely a welcomed addition to the Japanese restaurant lineup in the city. \n\nThe interior has a stylish, modern look. I came on valentine&#39;s day and the table set up was private and intimate. \n\nEverything tasted fresh with distinct, clean flavors. There were so many delicious sounding appetizers that I wanted to try them all! Some of my favorite dishes were the raw oysters, the dragon roll, and the salmon belly. Make sire to order some items off of the special&#39;s menu to try some sashimi from Japan. \n\nI was very impressed by the food and the service. Akira will be my new go to place for quality, authentic sushi.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        The quality of the fish is fresh and very good. Portions were decent. The prices reasonable for this part of town. Nice cozy environment and friendly service.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Very friendly and efficient staff. Beautifully presented food. Love that they have so many cooked options for the dinner guests who aren&#39;t into sushi. The sushi is not the quality of Saru/Ijji/Juni but fine for lunch. Love the bar seating.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        I went there yesterday for dinner.\nService are awesome, the quality of fish is nice.\nGreen tea mochi ice surprised me. \nMochi part is soft and the aroma of green tea ice cream spill in my mouth like heaven.\nI will definitely go again.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        New young blood Japanese restaurant with professional chef which impressed me the most !!\n\nI would definitely come back!!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        This place is awesome! Super fresh tasty fish and great flavors, the chefs really know what they&#39;re doing. Couldn&#39;t get enough of the Akira cucumber roll!\n\nGreat service as well, our waiter was super friendly and chill.

Their cold mezze platter is worth every penny of the $25 we paid for it! For the entree we did the lamb wrapped in pita with yogurt sauce. The yogurt in general at this place is pretty unreal in the best way possible. \n\nThe service was stellar, and while the place is small, I did not feel like I needed to yell at my BF ie the noise level is on point. \n\nAt one point the door was left ajar, and the waiter was quick to close it. \n\nI recommend this spot to everyone, except maybe a vegan, as the veggie options were limited.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        I was lucky enough to be introduced to Tuba by a good friend.  Decided to go back the other day and wasn&#39;t disappointed!\n\nWe ended up getting wine and dessert which put us in the $$$ category per person, but we knew what we were getting into.\n\nThe cold platter was an excellent way to start the meal and something that I will continue to get each time I come here.  It is the perfect starter for three, but could be overwhelming for two.\n\nFrom there we got the braised lamb shank, which fell off the bone.  The one we usually get on the menu, is the marinated lamb chops, which is equally fantastic.  Baklava with turkish tea for me to round off the meal was a great finish.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        We had a great time at Tuba . The food is pretty authentic . We had the marinated lamb chops and Adana kebab as mains . Done to perfection . Will go back again . \n\nUpdate: Went back again today. The food was as awesome as always. Lamb shank is served on Fridays and Saturday&#39;s\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Came here for dinner and didn&#39;t expect this place to be as busy or romantic as it was!\n\nWe only had to wait briefly for a table for two, and I was a bit taken aback by the abrupt way we were greeted: &#34;do you have a reservation&#34; followed by &#34;please wait outside.&#34; That was the only rough patch of the night. Once we were seated, service was fantastic, courteous, and food was beautifully plated and flavored.\n\nI&#39;ve never had Turkish food before, so I was completely in love with the meze plate (cold platter of all the dips and an endless bread basket of their deliciously soft sesame bread. I could live off of that stuff forever! We got the fish special (not on the menu) and found out it was BREAM! Haven&#39;t had that before...but it was cooked to perfection, and we chose to dine with the bone in--best option. We also shared the large &#34;light&#34; Turkish beer. We wanted the dark one, but they ran out of it, and surprisingly the light was something I&#39;d totally order again! I don&#39;t like lagers or pilsners, but this lager had a hint of honey and was so floral, I loved it.\n\nService was top-notch. They clear your dirty plates and smile/hold eye contact with you to the point before you start feeling uncomfortable. Hah, but I&#39;d totally go back again. Surprisingly it was not as expensive as I thought it would be with the lofty decor and old-school vibes, which is great for a fancier night out without the pomp and circumstance!\n\nHats off to Tuba, so glad we came here.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Tuba&#39;s Turkish food is as good as it gets. The restaurant&#39;s elegant appearance and welcoming staff contributed to our positive experience, and ultimately provided the ideal ending to a fun day of hiking and sightseeing.\n\nAll of the mezes we ordered were delicious, but the falafel was the most memorable by far. It was served on a bed of hummus, and paired perfectly with their complimentary warm bread. The falafel wasn&#39;t greasy or overly dense, and the spices in each piece were very pronounced.\n\nThe fried eggplant in the K\u0131zartma was fresh, and the dish contained a relatively even amount of eggplant distributed among the bell peppers and zucchini. And while the portion was small, it was still satisfying.\n\nI can&#39;t speak for the meat dishes, such as the \u0130\u00e7li K\u00f6fte, but I can say that all of our plates were polished off by the end of dinner. Visually similar to breaded meatballs or rice balls, the \u0130\u00e7li K\u00f6fte were stuffed with spicy ground beef and crushed walnuts, covered in bulgur wheat, and pan-fried. The meze includes two big pieces, which doesn&#39;t look like a lot, but is sufficient for a couple of people to share.\n\nBy the time we left Tuba, we were stuffed. We wish we could&#39;ve ordered additional items from the menu that night, because we weren&#39;t disappointed by any of the mezes we tried!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        The food is delicious. Staff are good but can seem unfriendly at times. The owner, however, is super nice and always trying to make sure you enjoy your experience.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        I was really impressed by the food and service here! The atmosphere feels very warm and welcoming. Prices are a little high but well worth it for the quality.\n\nThey give you free delicious bread to start. For the entree I ordered the Musakka ($22) which was eggplant stuffed with potatoes and zucchini covered with cheese and bechamel sauce. It&#39;s served with a small rice and salad. I could not get enough of the rice! It was so flavorful and the texture was perfect. The rest of the dish was filling and very rich from the cheese and sauce. I also tried some of the miniature beef patties from my friend&#39;s Kofte ($22) entree and I preferred hers slightly more.\n\nOverall wonderful place to get authentic Turkish food!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Excellent Food and Service - will be returning!\n\nI am usually critical of Turkish restaurants in the US, since I always compare them to the food in Istanbul. However, the food here was incredible, I ordered the house special lamb shank and my friend ordered the eggplant with ground beef entree, both were tremendously flavorful and beautifully presented. The bread and sides were also high quality and the prices were very reasonable for what I would consider a nice SF sit down spot. \n\nThe service of the staff was remarkable, I casually mentioned it was my friend&#39;s birthday and they made the dessert quite a fun and memorable experience. \n\nI suggest making a reservation ahead of time as this can be quite busy on a weekend evening.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Okay. I just have to take a second to disagree with the other reviewers who say you don&#39;t get a lot for what you pay. \n\nWe left STUFFED. Between two people, we split the Tuba Meze Tabagi (basically the cold appetizer sampler), Adana Kebab (beef and lamb kabob with grilled veggies), and the Kofte (beef patties with grilled veggies). The appetizer sampler is excellent, though probably better suited for 4+ people (our server told us that, but our eyes were bigger than our appetite). Both entrees were excellent, hot and full of flavor.\n\nI must note that this was my first taste of authentic Turkish food, so I am not an expert by any means. But I know what good food is, and Tuba is bound to satisfy. The interior is cozy and intimate, creating a truly authentic dining experience. Highly recommend!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Came back and it was really good and deserves another star. Service was excellent and the grilled lamb chops marinated for 3 days are a must order. The dessert of some kind of cheese fried between philo with a honey glaze and ice cream was amazing. Our waitress was sweet and prompt. Recommended.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        I was very excited about trying out this restaurant when my Los Angeles friends happened to eat here, and told me they enjoyed this restaurant so much they wished there was one just like it here in Los Angeles. Being from Los Angeles myself, I made sure I visited Tuba Restaurant the next time I came to San Francisco. \n\nI called and booked ahead of time. Reserved a table for a party of 9 people. I told them over the phone that I was from Los Angeles and how excited I was about trying their authentic Turkish cuisines. \n\nAt first glance, the restaurant is chic and cozy, on a cute little street. Street parking was hard to find. \n\nOnce we sat down, with my American family, I introduced myself to the server and told them that I am Turkish and that I am very excited to be here. I told them about how much my friends had raved about their food, and thus, I brought my whole American family from San Francisco to try their food. \n\nWe decided to eat family style, with lots of big dishes to share. At first we ordered a bunch of appetizers. \n\nSo here is the part that drops the stars from 5 to 3: \nThe first combo appetizer plate we get, I take a bite off the spinach dip and there is a hair in it! Immediately I spit it out, quietly, and drop it off to the floor so the rest of my party is not grossed out. But I am now very grossed out and dissapointed. \nI then call our server and tell her, quietly, in Turkish, that I got hair in my food. \nShe looks at me in disbelief, and instead of apologizing, grabs my plate and brings me a new one. I decide that I am not going to ruin my whole family&#39;s experience so I tell no one. \nAfter all the appetizers are finished and we move on to the entree, the same server comes back and asks how everything was. I tell her the food was good, and then she says, &#34;well I hope the good food made up for the bad start&#34;.  I tell her &#34;yes&#34; and we continue to eat. \n\nWe order: \nappetizer plate\nsigara borek\nseveral plates of lamb, several plates of combination kebabs, \nManti\nTurkish wine, \nVarious deserts: Kunefe, baklava, helva, chocolate pyramid\nTurkish coffee and turkish tea.\n\nOur bill is $500 plus tip.\n\nSo here is my verdict: \n\n1) Although they had charged us 20% gratuity, they never told us so my husband ended up giving them an additional 20% tip on top \n\n2) Even though the food was great, the hair in my food at the very beginning was a big buzz kill. What was even more annoying was at no point did they attempt to apologize about it. She just kind of looked at me in disbelief. What I expected, instead, was for them to apologize and perhaps bring a desert as a gesture for apology. Generally, in such establishments, that is the right thing to do. Especially for a table this big, who just dropped almost $500 for food, the least you could do is take out a desert or two off the bill as a sweet gesture of apology. \n\nYes, the food was good and the ambiance was lovely. But I wish they had better courtesy.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        So we were going out to dinner last night and the place we wanted to go to is now closed on Monday so our friend suggested Tuba. Now I love Turkish food so I was game and when we got to Tuba I had seen them there, ate at at restaurants over the years next door and across the street but never at Tuba. The were welcoming and sat us down right away. We order two appitizers, one being the Haydari which was to dye for. I could eat this every day! Dinner came and all the my dinner companions food all looked delicious and they all said it was. I ordered the Tavuk Sote which cane with rice and a small side salad, so good. We ordered one desert which was their signature desert that i cannot remember the name but it was a flakey dough, with honey and a side of vanilla ice cream, a must and next time I will get my own! The service was friendly and near perfect and I will be going back soon.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        So this was our back up for the night and I am glad we had to choose the back up cause it was so worth it. The kunefe desert was amazing and something we food mongers started with. We order the cold meze platter, the falafel plate, from entrees we ordered eggplant and marinated chicken and everything was super yummy. \n\nThe Turkish tea and coffee after our meal with baklava made everything perfect. I would recommend this place to anyone who loves food, and you have so many options here, regardless of your dietary restrictions. So all you vegetarian friends, vegan lovers or gluten free people , this is the place for you. \n\nThe staff is polite and amiable , and ambience is of a typical Turkish place, cozy and warm.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        It was good. For the price, it really wasn&#39;t all that good. \n\nThe ambiance is alright, it&#39;s pretty basic. \n\nA few friends and I came to dinner on a Friday night. We made a reservation for six people. I ended up going for the item on the specials menu lamb shank, tender cook, nice tasty sauce and the shank was huge. Dinosaur bone style!\n\nI pretty much cleaned my plate and was super full. I liked it, but my meal and the beer came out to $45. Yikes. Wish I&#39;d come in prepared to blow that much. \n\nMy partner ordered lamb kebob, which he liked but said was under whelming and not worth the money. \n\nOverall, good food but I&#39;d rather go somewhere else any day.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Ordered the K\u00f6fte. It&#39;s basically a couple of pieces of slider sized hamburger patties cooked with Turkish spices served with salad. I&#39;m glad it took awhile for it to come out because that meant they freshly prepared it and it showed. Very juicy and the Turkish spices cooked into gave it a nice taste to it. It went well with the Elfes Plisner I ordered for a drink. I&#39;m not sure exactly what type of rice it came with but it was just sticky enough for me. Friendly staff that took their time to make an earnest suggestion about what to order on the menu. The restaurant ambiance was nice but a bit noisy as I found myself almost yelling to have a conversation.\n\nI&#39;m not surprised anymore that restaurant is still a fixture in this spot when all the surrounding restaurants in the area have practically come and gone over the years.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Good food, but WAY too expensive for what it is. Also the Moussaka had NO LAMB, and was cooked with mozzarella cheese. \n\nIf you want upscale Mediterranean - go to Kokkari. Greek is not Turkish, but it&#39;s similar food with much better price to quality to experience ratio.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        My Turkish friend told us about this place, and since I have been to Turkey I wanted to experience again their wonderful flavors!\nWe made the booking one week in advance... but apparently it wasn&#39;t worth the effort because they got confused with our reservation and made us wait for a while even when our table was ready, good thing they made it up with dessert! \nWe started with the Turkish wine, which was really nice with full body. The Tuba Meze came, with all of its delicious flavors, by the time we finished it we were getting pretty full but our entrees were on their way... mine was the H\u00fcnkarBe\u011fendi which I highly recommend! \nFor a great finale we got Baklava and of course Turkish coffee!!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Everything we ate here was fantastic and the service was commensurate with the quality of the meal. We will definitely return as it just catapulted itself to my favorite middle eastern / Mediterranean place in the city. \nTheir signature dessert is to DIE for. As are the three day lamb chops.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        I been there one time and the place is one of the best place to eat medeterranean and Turkish food in Bay area..I really liked their food..Baklava and Turkish tea also was amazing..But I faced something bad thing that I have ever faced in us..we went there with my classmate..There was a waiter I think he is Italian..And he was racist toward my classmate..When he acted as a racist I was in restroom and I couldn&#39;t see it..After we left the place my classmate told me that she was faced with racist and disrespectful actions..One day after I called the place and they said the owner is going to contact with you but nobody call me\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        They had the place beautifully setup for Valentine&#39;s Day! The food here is amazing! The chicken I had was very flavorful and juicy. I would come back here again in future.\n    \n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        \n\n            \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            Tuba Authentic Turkish Restaurant", "url": "/biz/tuba-authentic-turkish-restaurant-san-francisco", "hours": "Mon                    5:00 pm - 10:00 pm                                                                Tue                    5:00 pm - 10:00 pm                                                                                Wed                    5:00 pm - 10:00 pm                                                                Thu                    5:00 pm - 10:00 pm                                                                Fri                    5:00 pm - 11:00 pm                                                                Sat                    5:00 pm - 11:00 pm                                                                Sun                    5:00 pm - 10:00 pm", "tele": "(415) 826-8822", "address": "1007 Guerrero StSan Francisco, CA 94110", "imageList": ["https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Yb3DW8sBwqShHS2NGF96SA/ls.jpg", "eb3727aff515ba497b37ee07e96a60ca.jpg"], "type": "Mediterranean,\n                    Turkish,\n                    Middle Eastern"}

{"title": "div itemprop=\"review\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Review\">\n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        I come to Chinatown for THIS.  With so many dim sum places, it&#39;s so difficult to decide where to get your goodies from.  On my recent trip to Chinatown, I got my two favorite items - har gow and the steamed pork buns - from multiple places.  This place tops them all.  Not only are the servings ginormous, but they are DELICIOUS, even when re-heated the next day (yeah, I&#39;m surprised that I didn&#39;t eat them all that same day).  The har gow had a large shrimp portion and the wrapper/casing (whatever you call it) was super tasty.  The thickness was just perfect and it was nice and soft.  The pork buns were equally delicious and steamed to perfection.\n\nThe line is longer than a lot of the to-go places, but obviously for good reason.  The prices are ridiculously good.  However, I went around 2 PM yet a lot of the items were out.  I&#39;d love to come back soon to check out all of the goods that they have to offer.\n\nBe sure to buy a ton of goodies to take home because they reheat really well!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Dim Sum to go!\n\nI walked by here the other day, and while grabbing lunch in Chinatown we decided to grab some dumplings here while we walked. \n\nI was able to try the Shiu Mai and the Shrimp Dumplings, both of which were fantastic. The Shiu Mai was our favorite and it was a savory, meaty, open-faced dumpling treat. The Shrimp Dumplings were solid and the Shrimp were sweet and plentiful.\n\nIf you are walking around Chinatown and want a tasty snack, look no further than Good Mong Kok!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Shrimp dumplings all day!\n\nThis place is a typical, cash-only/take-out spot  deep in Chinatown. Highly recommend for a quick lunch. And yes, the shrimp dumplings are amazing here.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        I&#39;ve tried just about every dim sum place in Chinatown and always avoid this place because the line is too long\n\nI had plenty of time today, so got in line and it took about 15 minutes. This was about 11 am on a Tuesday \n\nWe had the baked pork bun (1), chicken shu mai (3), and the shrimp and chive dumplings (3).  They were all exclllent, the largest sized dim sum I&#39;ve ever had, btw\n\nAnd three seasame balls for dessert, also perfection\n\n\nTotal order was $7.60\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        One of my favorite places for cheap eats pretty much in the entire world! \n\nI try to come here every time I am in SF. There is always a massive line but well worth the wait!\n\nI am not a fan of the green onion pancake as it is not as fresh as the other items. I&#39;m assuming the same for anything other than the true dim sum items. I would stick with the hot, steamy dim stuff items like the shrimp dumpling, pork buns, sio mai. You know, the ones where they&#39;re bringing massive trays out every 10 Min. Pretty much any dumpling is phenomenal. You could eat like a KING for $5.\n\nThis place defines Chinatown SF for me. Can&#39;t wait for my next visit.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Really dig this place, pretty much ordered everything from my childhood memories like Charsiubao, shumai, sesame red bean balls, that gelatinous white cake, and that brown looking cake (Since I am a total failure at Chinese food names). \n\nExpect a line in the morning and they don&#39;t sell drinks here.  Also, expect total attitudes from the ladies behind the counter. What else do you expect from awesome Chinese eats? \n\nWhen coming from Union square, just go through the bridge underpass, hopefully it won&#39;t smell like pee. When finished buying from here, you got to go eat it elsewhere since seating is non-existent here. \n\nYou&#39;re welcome.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Meh, came here today for lunch and I&#39;m not really a fan.\n\nSame concept as Tao Yuen in Oakland Chinatown. Cheap eats, fairly big portions.\n\nThe lines here are out the door (the shop next door will tell you to move if you&#39;re blocking their entrance). Line moves extremely slowly, so be patient.\n\nTheir menu is listed on the wall, but you&#39;re only able to see a few of the selection as they&#39;re all under the steamers. Ladies here aren&#39;t very friendly either.\n\nFood was lackluster. Ha gow and siu mai were just OK, but for the value, it can&#39;t be beat. I believe it was 3 pieces for $1.20. The shrimp and chive dumplings were probably the best out of the dumpling selection. Steamed BBQ pork bun was also tasty.\n\nI&#39;d avoid ordering the turnip cakes as they&#39;re extremely bland and doughy.\n\nOverall, great place to come by if you&#39;re on a budget and looking for a quick bite. I still prefer Tao Yuen, so I probably would not return based on the vast selection of restaurants in SF Chinatown.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Did a search for all day dim sum in Chinatown, and saw three yelp friends had also been here. After reading their reviews I was sold. I wasn&#39;t looking for a sit down dim sum service, so this was perfect. Stopped by here for a couple har gaw and char siu bao. The line was small and my husband waited outside while I ordered, as it&#39;s tight quarters. I asked for 2 BBQ pork buns and she kept saying they were out, but I&#39;m roughly 90% certain that&#39;s what I wound up getting. If it wasn&#39;t pork, it was still yummy and I don&#39;t need to know anything else. I wanted 2 shrimp dumplings but she gave me 2 orders I think, which was fine. They were fresh and delicious. \n\nEverything set me back around $6, such a bargain! I knew we were looking to grab a slice of pizza or share a panini in little Italy, so this was a great option. Would definitely come back!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        LOVE LOVE LOVE! \nSuper cheap and delicious! \n\nWe came here for breakfast, Saturday AND Sunday this past weekend. They open at 7am, our hotel wasn&#39;t far and we had 2 full packed days of sight seeing so. Org morning we were there between 7.30am and 8am, little line but not bad. And there&#39;s no choice but to have a line because there&#39;s no seating. Take out only. \n\nBoth days we were the only non-Asians in line, and you know what they say, eat only where the Asians eat! The staff all spoke English and were nice to us but you have to be quick and have an idea of what you want. \n\nWe got 2 x steamed BBQ pork buns, Prawn dumplings (3) and beef shu mahi (3) on the first day. $7! That&#39;s all! And the pork buns are huge!! \nThe next day we got the same and added another prawn type of goyza and 2 x combination something...total was $11\n\nCan&#39;t get better than that!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        A little store front in the mist of Chinatown in SF. Not the friendliest service nor the most sanitary place, but is the food delicious! Greeted by 2 ladies that didn&#39;t care to suggest anything and just waited impatiently to order my to go dim sum selections. Ended with sesame balls (which were gia-nomrous), shu mai, and har gow. They sell in orders of 1 or 3 I believe, I opted for 3 for all 3 choices. The prices ranged from $1.50-$3.00, which is crazy cheap for the size the items.\n\nWhat I thought was not sanitary is that they would wear gloves to get your food, but give you money and change with the same glove. Doesn&#39;t that defeat the purpose of that? Money is one of the dirtiest thing in the world. Anyways, come with a strong stomach and enjoy these deliciousness on the street!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        My first two times - 4 stars (large portions, good flavors, cheap).\n\nI just went at 5:30pm today. They still had another hour until closing, but they were pretty much out of a lot of things (no baked BBQ pork bun or Chinese donut)! I came there for the fish and preserved egg porridge anyways because I am recovering from an upset stomach. I got home and the porridge had no fish OR egg....just tons of peanuts. Even if they messed up and gave me the other porridge, it would have been the pork and egg one. They probably just wanted to get rid of the last of their porridge, but that&#39;s just wrong......would I expect anything less? Not really lol\n\nI am a bitter bear right now so I&#39;ll take a nice long break from Good Mong Kok.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Came here to get some dim sum in Chinatown like an excited basic foodie. Had the sticky rice with pork, shark fin dumplings, shrimp dumplings, sesame balls, egg tart, and some other goodies.\n\nWhen we finally got inside (it&#39;s very cramped), I started ordering for my family. Maybe I wasn&#39;t ordering quickly enough, or the women were annoyed I was the only person ordering in English, but they were probably the least friendliest staff. They also only gave us 1 sesame ball when the order is supposed to come with 3. I&#39;m not sure if this was a mistake or if they were purposefully trying to take advantage of us. Either way, though the food was good, they were rude and it didn&#39;t seem like they really cared for my business, so they won&#39;t get it again.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        TLDR: The wait times are ridiculous but the egg tarts are delicious! \n\nWhenever I visit SF, I stay with a friend in Chinatown and try to get her to come here. She always resists, saying the wait is too long and there are other places she&#39;d rather go. Finally I got my fix when a foodie friend was willing to wait! If you don&#39;t go early, they&#39;ll be out of a lot of things so plan your day around an early morning stop here. I&#39;m not even an egg tart fan, but the ones here are great. The pork buns are also highly recommended. Will be getting the much-hyped har gow next time!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        BOMB.COM!\n\nCheap and fast dim sum? YAS! This place has been around for years, I have been here since I was little, definitely brings back memories! They have delicious dim sum here, it kind of like a food court, you order what you want (quickly) and then box it for you and pay. No more waiting at a restaurant, this place is just as good! Some of my favorite is the fried turnip, shrimp dumping, fried pork dumpling, and thick noodle rolls! So delicious and worth it. Must try!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        The pork buns had been calling me for weeks before my trip to the Bay.\n\nWe got the last single steamed pork bun even though the guy directly behind me tried to cut in front of me and get it.\n\nWhen I began to eat it, I noticed the bread to meat filling ratio didn&#39;t work for me. There was just too much bread - enough to the point where my mouth became dry.\n\nWhat we took home, we heated up the next morning, and by mid-day, we were ill. I&#39;m still sad about this.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Tasty take-out\n\nCash only, small, and a little quite chaotic, you better be ready to order when called. I had the best BBQ pork buns I&#39;ve had in years and as well as some pretty tasty siu mai and har gow. I ate while walking before finishing my order in a chilly playground.  It was darn pretty enjoyable. Inexpensive too. \n\nWorth a quick visit, even if just for a little snack.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        This was a hole in the wall joint that I was so glad we stumbled upon!! We were craving a snack and decided to come here for the good yelp reviews. The line was a little long but it moves quickly (takes maybe 10 min?). It helps if you speak Chinese though or take a friend who does Hahahah. I didn&#39;t expect much since it was such a small store and you have to take all your food Togo (there&#39;s no place to sit). \n\nWe ordered the shu Mai which was delicious !!!!! So juicy &amp; meaty. My favorite was actually the shrimp dumpling thing (ha-gao) which I normally don&#39;t like but here it was so delicious ! The shrimp were nice and plump, and the dumpling part had he perfect consistency. Wow !!! We also got the turnip cakes which were also yummy.\n\nWe got an order of each which comes in orders of 3 pieces, all for 7 bucks !!! What a steal!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        The best to-go dim sum I have had in Chinatown. Hot, fresh, tasty, and affordable for everyone! The portion sizes are HUGE. The biggest steamed BBQ pork I&#39;ve ever gotten from a dim sum place, enough to keep me full for a while. The shrimp dumplings are BIG (no joke) and are perfect if you&#39;re craving some shrimp. I ordered 3 shrimp dumplings, 1 steamed BBQ pork bun, 1 sticky rice, 1 pineapple bun, 3 chive dumplings, and the small chow mein for ~$11-12. The food is worth every penny. \n\nYou know this place is good because erryone wants some and there&#39;s always a line out the door. Sometimes they sell out of the good stuff in the mornings. They have a menu in English on the wall, just be prepared and have an idea of what you want to order by the time you to get to the door because you have to order fast once it&#39;s your turn. It&#39;s how they keep the line moving. Check out Yelp pics while waiting in line if you need help deciding!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        I originally wanted to find a sit down restaurant for dim sum in SF Chinatown but after reading many great reviews of Mong Kok I decided I have to try this place out! When we arrived at 9:30 AM in the morning, there was already a line outside. We got in line and I used the time waiting to see what items are recommended by other reviews. I saw a lot of people saying their shu mai and shrimp and chive dumplings are good so we went with that. The line moved pretty fast so it was shortly my turn to order. You can order whatever quantity you like so I got 2 shu mai, 2 shrimp and chive dumplings, 1 baked bbq pork bun, and 1 pineapple bun to go. It was less than $5 total. We stood in front of the place to eat everything while they&#39;re still hot. I was thinking how it would taste without the soy sauce since they didn&#39;t give us any as we would expect when we go to a sit down place. \n\nMuch to my surprise, everything tasted so delicious and very well seasoned. You don&#39;t need soy sauce at all. The dumplings are much bigger than other places and have a lot of stuffings inside. They are so good that we decided to come back and get 10 more! :) the baked bbq pork was also really tasty and much better than the ones I had in Boston or New York. The pineapple bun was okay though, nothing impressive about it. \n\nI highly recommend trying this place out if you&#39;re in the area and want high quality yet affordable dim sum.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Ridiculously good and worth waiting in line. We just had snacks-- har gow and egg custard tart because there&#39;s nowhere to sit---it&#39;s awkward to eat dim sum in the street but we did it anyway. Amazingly cheap too!!! I loved walking the neighborhood too with all the food markets and hustle bustle of the real Chinatown.\n    \n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        \n\n            \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            Good Mong Kok Bakery", "url": "/biz/good-mong-kok-bakery-san-francisco", "hours": "Mon                    7:00 am - 6:30 pm                                                                Tue                    7:00 am - 6:30 pm                                Open now                                                Wed                    7:00 am - 6:30 pm                                                                Thu                    7:00 am - 6:30 pm                                                                Fri                    7:00 am - 6:30 pm                                                                Sat                    7:00 am - 6:30 pm                                                                Sun                    7:00 am - 6:30 pm", "tele": "(415) 397-2688", "address": "1039 Stockton StSan Francisco, CA 94108", "imageList": ["https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/79Q5Vz23DZ7V8qiczkZC3g/ls.jpg", "f083d2c3f776b6bf5b92314046fd7d95.jpg"], "type": "Bakeries,\n                    Dim Sum,\n                    Cantonese"}

I can&#39;t believe I didn&#39;t know about this place. The staff are dressed in amazing cultural outfits and the food is prepared with spices that are super fresh. When the servers come around asking if you want to try a special item, I highly recommend it! They offered me fried grasshopper! Definitely bring your family and friend&#39;s here.\n\nRecommended dish: pad thai with pork belly\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Surpassing expectations.  Tasty food.  Had the northern Thai sausage, herb rice salad, roast pork, and pork belly curry.  A bit pricey -$120 for two people, but SF prices stopped phasing me a while ago.\n\nBut most annoying part of the dinner is when they bring out ice cream for birthdays and their loud banging gongs and trying to make the birthday person wear a ridiculous &#34;Thai&#34; hat.  I wonder if that&#39;s just a ploy to amuse the westerners.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        most authentic thai food in SF. i would recommend getting the following:\n-chicken wings\n-ahi scoops\n-thai street green curry noodes: very spicy!\n-hat yai fried chicken\n-panang neua\n-tom yum\n-herbal rice salad\n-all the currys\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        I came here for a friend&#39;s birthday with a party of 7. We loved most of the food and the desserts we ordered. I especially liked the Num Tok beef rolls which were delicious. \n\nThe ginger milk tea won the day. It was by far the best ginger milk tea I&#39;ve had. I would definitely to back to have it again. \n\nThe only draw back is that they wouldn&#39;t sit us till most of the party was there even though we had a reservation,  they had just opened the restaurant and it wasn&#39;t packed at all. On the bright side,I got to try the ginger milk tea while waiting at the bar :-)\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Farmhouse Kitchen in the outskirts of the Mission District is undoubtedly one of the most beautifully and colorfully-decorated restaurants I&#39;ve ever visited. Inside, there are colorful flags and art all over, as well as antiques that make you feel like you stepped back in time and into the opposite side of the world! Above all, however, the waiters were super friendly (and were all wearing water guns strapped to their shoulders--apparently in honor of a New Years festival/tradition that happens in Thailand) and the food absolutely amazing!\n\nI came for lunch with a group of four, but the portion sizes are quite big, so we ordered three main dishes to share, and it was more than enough! The Kai Yang, Som Tum plate came with the most tender barbecue chicken I&#39;ve ever had (marinated in turmeric and coconut), along with a bamboo steamer of chewy sticky rice, a dish of spicy, pungent papaya salad, and a vinegary spicy sauce for dipping. What an amazing, perfectly balanced combination! \n\nThe Thai Street Green Curry Noodles were also amazing--the delicious, fragrant curry came with chunks of bone-in dark meat chicken and plenty of vegetables including eggplant, bell pepper, and bamboo. But the most amazing part of the curry was that you could taste the depth and variety of herbs that were used--so fresh, fragrant, and complex! The dish was served with rice noodles, bean sprouts, and pickled veggies on the side for a great combination.\n\nHowever, the dish that impressed me the most in terms of flavor was actually one of the most simple--the Mok Salmon, which consisted of grilled wild salmon wrapped in a banana leaf with oyster mushroom, and served with grilled asparagus, blue rice, and a spicy cilantro lime sauce. The best part of the dish was definitely the salmon. Like the other dishes we had, you could really taste all of the pungent herbs and spices that were cooked with the salmon--the depth and level of the flavors were unbelievable, yet the salmon wasn&#39;t overpowered at all! The blue rice was also particularly fragrant (though I have no idea how they make this!), and the spicy cilantro sauce went perfectly with every component of this dish.\n\nFarmhouse Kitchen deserves 5+ stars for the finesse of their dishes--not only is the plating absolutely beautiful, but the execution is unparalleled, and every single dish I tried was perfectly seasoned, and the components were perfectly well-balanced. I&#39;ll be back!!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Incredibly authentic and amazing! Thai vibes with awesome customer service. \n\nWe ordered a lot of food, but I solely remembered my 24 hour beef bone! Must get here! Despite the price, I think it&#39;s worth trying this place. The servers are super friendly and they also do a special birthday celebration if you dine here for your birthday.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Something about this place just makes me want to come back. I think it&#39;s the whole dining experience. I&#39;ve been here multiple times, for lunch and dinner. I recommend dinner over lunch because the ambiance is more unique at dinnertime.\n \nAMBIANCE/DECOR\nLoud Thai music/songs playing and staff dressed in Thai cultural clothing at dinner time vs no music and staff dressed in t-shirts during lunch time. The place is cute and interestingly decorated, from a wall of faucets to the antique sewing machine at the hostess/check-in station. Each table has a small succulent plant.\n \nFOOD\nMost memorable items I&#39;ve had were the shrimp/prawn appetizer, fried calamari (it&#39;s not your usual calamari), short ribs (very tender and flavorful), Mary&#39;s chicken, and samosas (also like the curry sauce it comes with). They have specials that they print out on small cards.\n \nSERVICE\nGood service with each experience, still feel dinner service is a bit better. Food comes out fairly fast and they never took my order wrong. They take reservations for large parties in advance. Usually a wait for dinner, but usually no wait at lunch.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Fairly legit Thai food in the Mission with a reasonable price and nice ambiance. I&#39;ve gone for group lunches here and the lunch menu is a tasty food and generous portion size at good price. I like the balanced flavor profile and fresh spices of the food - doesn&#39;t rely on sugar or oil as poor Thai food does.\n\nDuring lunchtime, the service is fairly efficient and attentive. They&#39;ve never gotten my order wrong and the worst wait hasn&#39;t been that bad even when the place is at capacity. The ambiance and presentation are semi-bougie - bright colors, nostalgic surf rock music, a single table with plastic lawn chairs and tablecloth. Side note, the bathroom is clean and pleasant.\n\nTom Kha with Chicken - Sour, bright and citrusy kaffir lime flavor, coconut milk is savory but not too much or heavy. The consistency was still watery and not super rich or thick like curry, a good thing.\nBeef Salad - Slightly sweet and sour marinade, acidic dressing, fresh fibrous greens. Texture was like a chewy soft like bak kwa pork jerky.\nGreen Curry Chicken - A good sized portion for lunch. Only mildly spicy and a fairly thin, not soupy curry which I like. Very fragrant with bamboo shoots, basil. Had it with Jasmine rice.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Wow, I can&#39;t believe I haven&#39;t reviewed this place yet- it&#39;s definitely one of my neighborhood go-to spots. Great thai food and great service- it&#39;s a bit pricier than your normal thai joint but you can tell that they take great care to try to make the food as good as possible.\n\nWhatever you do, DO NOT bypass the short rib on your trip here. It&#39;s fall off the bone goodness paired with blue rice that you don&#39;t want to miss. The fried chicken is one of their famous dishes and it doesn&#39;t disappoint either. I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s better honestly- the chicken, or the roti and dipping sauce that comes with the dish. I&#39;ve asked for the sauce by itself a few times with no shame because it&#39;s that good.\n\nFor starters, skip the vegan fresh rolls- the wrapper is weirdly thick and not tasty. However, an order of the Neua Num Tok Rolls and Mieng Kum Kung prawns are well worth your time. The Tok Rolls are grilled and marinated flank steak wrapped up with cilantro and a cilantro lime dressing- really fresh and refreshing. The prawns are coconut battered and fried and also amazing.\n\nI&#39;ve had some of their curries here as well, which have always been good- but watch out if you don&#39;t want bones in to make sure you order the right curry!\n\nBYO is $20 a bottle if you choose to go that route. There isn&#39;t a full bar, but they do have beer and wine!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Celebrated my best friend&#39;s birthday here last Sunday. I have been wanting to try this place specifically for 2 things. One, because of how they greet the birthday celebrant before serving dessert and two, to try their bomb Hat Yai chicken. We started with some appetizers; Ahi tuna scoops, crispy tiger prawns, and calamari. (All freakin delicious) For entrees; most of us got yellow curry and Hat Yai Friend Chicken. (I definitely recommend trying the Hat Yai) Highlight of this dining experience: Pad See You dinner with crispy pork belly (we ordered 1 to share). TO DIE FOR. If I had to choose 1 dish from the menu, I&#39;d definitely pick that. \n\nI am only giving them 4 stars because although the service was pretty fast, they messed up our order, had us cut our own cake and gave us insufficient utensils and plate.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        This place has a pretty legit Thai food. I think the food is pretty authentic and yet it feels a bit modern at the same time. I love the open kitchen and the restaurant space.\n\nLike many other Thai restaurants, the menu is pretty big. Everything that I have tried so far is pretty good and tasty. My favorites from the appetizers were the Thai fish cake and the Neua num tok rolls. The fish cake was very fragrant with the fresh kaffir lime leaves, and the rolls were so delicious... it&#39;s basically rolled grilled flank steak with mint, cilantro and cucumber which came with a tangy dipping sauce... yum!\n\nFor the main course, I had enjoyed the BBQ chicken served with papaya salad; the hat yai fried chicken served with potato yellow curry; and the short rib panang neua. All dishes were cooked nicely, and the portion was pretty big and ideal for sharing. The seasoning and spice level were spot on, and the ingredients tasted fresh.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Food:\n\n24 hour beef rib noodle soup - though it&#39;s not bad in flavor, the beef was a bit dry and the noodle portion is pretty small unfortunately.  Not to mention it&#39;s a bit on the pricy side especially for lunch.  \n\nService: great waitstaff and very attentive.\n\nAmbiance: a cool neighborhood joint tho it&#39;s probably more geared towards the hipsters.\n\nOverall: maybe once in a great while I&#39;d come back but it&#39;s not on the top of my list.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        ***MORE LIKE A 3.5*** \n\nMy sister and brother in law put it on hella thick that this spot was going to be good and it was the &#34;best&#34; Thai spot they&#39;ve been to out in the Bay so I had to try it! They also said everything they had was HELLA good. With that said, I ordered a variety of things off the menu and I can&#39;t say I had the same experience. \n\nFirst impression, I liked their little hidden location. I thought the place itself was hella cute and decorated fun. I wanted to take that flower pot/center piece home lol but I took a picture of it instead. The service was like other people have said it was so-so. I didn&#39;t think they were hella friendly and they weren&#39;t hella rude BUT I did feel rushed towards the end when hella people started lining up outside the doors. Luckily, because it was planned I set up reservations around 6 PM this past Sunday so it wasn&#39;t hella busy when we first came in. Also, I don&#39;t know if I was just distracted but I was surprised at how fast everything came out. \n\nAs for the food, I listed what we ordered and my personal opinion: \n\nSTARTERS \n- Ahi scoops: hella cute to look at &amp; tasted just as good too, the fish was fresh, the flavor had a little kick to it, know that they only come with 4 servings though \n- Thai fish cakes: this wasn&#39;t anything extraordinary but it wasn&#39;t bad, I think this came with 6 cakes and crispies underneath \n- Kobe beef jerky: I know it&#39;s supposed to be jerky but I thought it was a little too dry LOL, either that or it really didn&#39;t have any flavor it was more something to chew on but it is good with the lime-y sauce \n- Mieng Kum Kung: unfortunately didn&#39;t get to try this because it&#39;s my sisters favorite thing from this spot lol and everyone ate it all, there wasn&#39;t enough to serve our table so order appropriately lol \n\nSPECIAL \n- Mok salmon: I like how they wrapped it with the fresh dill on top added a LITTLE flavor, and they didn&#39;t overcook the salmon, it is better with the green sauce which I am assuming is something cilantro-lime-y \n- Panang neua: the best thing here according to my sister and brother in law, I agree there is a lot of flavor, sweeter than I am used to but still hella good! The meat falls right off the bone \n- Hat Yai fried chicken: the &#34;other&#34; best thing, again I lucked out trying this one but I did try the dipping sauce and again, lots of flavor and if you like your curry sweet it&#39;s good. \n\nTHAI STREET FOOD \n- Pad See You: My family ordered this last minute so I was too stuffed to try it. My brother said it was the best he had because he could tell the noodles were fresh and prepared there \n\nSOUP\n- Tom yum: one of the main reasons I had to knock them down some, this arrived fast but HELLA cold like nobody wants cold soup (well at my table anyway) and on top of that the spoon they gave me was hella too big to scoop stuff out, there wasn&#39;t enough broth to serve to everyone at my table, the flavor was good extra tangy and spicy which I liked but don&#39;t expect more than 6 prawns, I prefer more of a seafood combination option \n\nSALAD \n- Yum Moo Krob: I thought &#34;garden vegetables&#34; was going to be more like a typical salad but it was just pork belly on top of hard cabbage with a sauce similar to what they put on the larb. I was disappointed this didn&#39;t taste as good as I hoped. To be honest, there was no crunch to the pork belly it was either prepared with too much moisture or it was sitting out for a while. It hurt my teeth to eat this lol. You know it&#39;s not crispy enough when the skin is like sticking to your teeth. My brother in law can cook a mean piece of lechon though, which I think most prefer crispy. \n\nSIDES \n- Side of asparagus: I liked this, not overcooked, still crispy, and who doesn&#39;t like garlic? \n- Side of bone broth: I don&#39;t know why I expected more from this lol but it was simple, not bad, kind of what you would get if you ordered broth at a pho restaurant \n\nDESSERT \nPlatter: Enough to feed our table lol, variety of things to choose from &amp; again cute \n\nOverall, I didn&#39;t hate it but I think my sister made me set high expectations. I think it would have been different if we didn&#39;t feel rushed and the soup was actually hot. I would come back and try the things I missed! Everything is definitely overpriced tho!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        I ordered the pumpkin curry, green curry, and pad see ew. I asked for the pumpkin curry to be Thai spicy, and the others to be medium spicy. \nAl 3 dishes were made Thai spicy. When I called to get the 2 dishes replaced, the guy on the phone argued with me, and told me that I must not be used to spice, and that I probably ate the spicy dish first, and that&#39;s why the other dishes were too spicy. \nAfter I told him that I tried the Pad see ew first, then the green curry, and those were crazy spicy, he told me I was wrong. \nHe wouldn&#39;t admit that they made the dishes wrong, and was a complete jerk over the phone. \nI love spicy food. I use tons of siracha on my meals. This was the spiciest food I&#39;ve ever tasted. \nForget these guys. They are assholes. Next time\nI&#39;ll order from Kitchen Story -- they always get the spicy levels right. Medium is medium -- not Thai spicy.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        This place has great decor and that pretty much it. \nThe food was pretty good. I would definitely recommend chicken wings, fried chicken and the crab fried rice. The fried chicken was very crispy and juicy. This is not like your normal KFC fried chicken. We also got the kickboxing bowl and it was delicious. It was lychee flavored with actual lychee pieces at the bottom which was a nice surprise.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Came here with a party of 6 on a Sunday night with reservations. It was a packed house! Even with reservations, we waited for about 15-20 min after. \n\n3 of us ordered the fried chicken dish, 1 ordered the pad kee mao with fried pork belly, 1 ordered the pad see ew with chicken and another person ordered the short rib. \n\nThe fried chicken dish is definitely worth the hype! Huge portion and really flavorful chicken. Loved the dipping sauce and the platha that came with it. I tried some of the pad see ew and thought it was tasty as well. \n\nEveryone seemed to really enjoy their dishes!\n\nService was attentive. But inside was extremely loud. It was a little hard to talk because we could barely hear each other, so just be aware of that. \n\nA bit on the pricey side, but portions were large!\n\nNote: if you&#39;re planning to split the bill, tell them in advance when you order.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        This place is soooooooo quirky - LOVE IT\n\nAmbiance: Hawaii meets Party City meets Thailand (Casual and homey)\n\nStaff: Super nice and accommodating, although I didn&#39;t understand what ours was saying half the time he was really nice, and when I asked what made the rice blue, he demonstrated by coming over with the blue flowers they use to dye the rice!  So cool!  \n\nFood: DELICIOUS - I had the salmon, it was a very generous portion and came with blue rice and some asparagus.  It was amazing. I tried some of the chicken curry which was great as well.  The shrimp dish was also quite good. Everything was good. \n\nI will definitely be back!  \n\nP.S. There is a surprise when you order the chicken curry.  ORDER IT! (Unless you&#39;re a vegan then good for you honey.)\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        This place has authentic thai food....eating here brought back so many food memories from when I was in thailand!!!! This is definitely on my list of one of favorite restaurants in sf!!!!\n\nThe thai iced tea was delcious. The food here is fantastic...so full of flavors. Yes, it is spicy but it&#39;s bearable...Definitely tell them to go easy on the spice level. The tofu soup was so good, did not expect this at all since i like meat in my soup. Our main entree was the hat Yai fried chicken...so crispy and yummy.\n\nThe food and aroma and everything is perfect here! Make reservations! This place is packed and I cannot wait to come back\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        TYPICAL TASTING THAI FOOD\n(3.5 stars)\n\nJust so you know... on yelp RSVP it said no opening until 5pm. However, at 3pm I was able to walk-in and get a table for 3. \n\nI wanted to like this place but I need to expect more than average tasting food. I guess restaurants in SF are doing new things to be &#34;creative&#34; to stand out in the crowd. Well, I&#39;ll be real with you - typical tasting thai food, nice presentation, but nothing to over bend the wallet. I don&#39;t get the concept of &#34;farmhouse&#34; and &#34;thai food&#34;. The ambiance was cute and clean but walking in didn&#39;t feel like I was a Thai restaurant. For example, you can uproot the thai restaurant and put an American(New) restaurant and the owner wouldn&#39;t have to change the decor. \n\n1. Servers were thai, food was authentic \n2. Service was good\n3. Menu had a decent selection \n4. Food was good\n5. Price wasn&#39;t worth it\n6. Try not to sit near the back wall. Why? Because it&#39;s near the one toilet unisex bathroom. And someone took a dump and the staff cracked the door and it smelt like shit. That&#39;s so gross, luckily we were done eating but that&#39;s just disgusting. \n\nNEUN NAM TOK ROLLS - it&#39;s basically cucumber, cilantro, and mint rolled up in meat. It was tasty but a little overrated. Average. And average shouldn&#39;t be expensive. The meat wasn&#39;t as tender as I&#39;d expect it for the price you pay. \n\nGREEN CURRY - with pork belly. Pork belly for the choice of meat was the best choice. They were bite size and crispy. But it would have been nice if they warned you this was spicy. Not just spicy but &#39;thai&#39; spicy. I could only handle one bite but that one bite was good. for those with sensitive stomach... be ware, it made my stomach lightly twist throughout 24hrs. RECOMMEND if you like spicy curry.\n\nGRILLED RIVER PRAWNS PAD THAI - this is from the special menu and not the regular pad Thai listed on the back of the menu. This special pad Thai is $8 difference. And honestly, nothing is special about it. Same Pad Thai with fried wontons and ONE big prawn cut in half (not plural prawnS) on top as garnish. No choice of meat, by default tofu is mixed in. It was good/decent/typical tasting Pad Thai but if you don&#39;t care for those garnishes save yourself $8 and get the regular pad Thai. RECOMMEND if you want to pricy Pad thai. \n\nPAD FRESH GINGER SAUCE - with chicken, shiitake mushrooms, white onion, green onion, and fresh ginger. LOL the name is ridiculous. Obviously they are Americanizing their menu but they should keep it authentic with the names, this is basically Gai Pad King. This was very good, but again typical tasting. RECOMMEND.\n\nSLATE BLUE/GRAY RICE - nothing special. Don&#39;t be fooled. It&#39;s just presentation. They cook rice with butterfly pea flower but it didn&#39;t change the the taste of the rice JUST THE COLOR. \n\nBUTTERFLY PEA FLOWER DRINK - not listed on their menu. But when the server mentioned how they prepared the rice, I recall having A butterfly pea flower drink in a different thai restaurant. Thy prepared it on my request and it wasn&#39;t as great as I had it before. It was like a sweet/sour lightly carbonated lemonade. Def not how I&#39;ve had it before and was kind of disappointed.\n\nNice ambiance, good food, but not a rush to come back. \n\nUntil the next review...\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        We came here for our first meal after landing in San Francisco. One of my friends highly recommended it. It is located in the Mission area of SF. We walked in during lunch hour and it was packed.\n\nAMBIENCE: The ambience was amazing. The restaurant is filled with an array of inviting colors, patterns, and textures. The music was fun and soothing. They did a good job in depicting some of the Thai culture in their design. Everyone seemed to be in good spirits and enjoying themselves.\n\nFOOD: We dined as a group of (3) and did family style in order to try as much as we can. We got the Kobe Beef Jerky, Chicken Wing (4 wings), Mok Salmon, Thai Street Green Curry Noodles, Kai Yang Som Tum, Iced Coffee Thai Way, and Honey Milk Lavender. The food was spot on! The portions are fairly large, so be mindful about that. The presentation of each dish was beautiful and creative. There was so much flavor packed in each bite but was not too overpowering. I liked how they put the sauces on the side - that way you had control over how spicy you wanted each bite to be. Overall, I would say the food was pretty authentic to traditional Thai style cuisine. \n\nSERVICE: The staff was busting their butts and moving quickly. We were seated fairly quickly but it took 10-15 minutes before anyone approached our table. Other than the initial long wait for our order to be placed, the experience after that was nothing short of fantastic. The staff was very friendly and attentive. I would definitely recommend trying this place out. We look forward to returning again!\n    \n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        \n\n            \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            Farmhouse Kitchen Thai Cuisine", "url": "/biz/farmhouse-kitchen-thai-cuisine-san-francisco", "hours": "Mon                    11:00 am - 2:00 pm5:00 pm - 10:00 pm                                                                Tue                    11:00 am - 2:00 pm5:00 pm - 10:00 pm                                                                                Wed                    11:00 am - 2:00 pm5:00 pm - 10:00 pm                                                                Thu                    11:00 am - 2:00 pm5:00 pm - 10:00 pm                                                                Fri                    11:00 am - 2:00 pm5:00 pm - 10:30 pm                                                                Sat                    12:00 pm - 10:30 pm                                                                Sun                    12:00 pm - 10:00 pm", "tele": "(415) 814-2920", "address": "710 Florida StSan Francisco, CA 94110", "imageList": ["https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/FRj8PVXEOsDWTn6C5rurxg/ls.jpg", "770676a5629e9c2e1efc5804fa8ae05d.jpg"], "type": "Thai,\n                    Comfort Food,\n                    Gluten-Free"}

{"title": "div itemprop=\"review\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Review\">\n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Lime Tree has been on my bookmarks for a while now and I finally had a chance to try it with two of my friends! We came at 6:30 on Friday night and there was no wait. However, by the time we left around 7:45, there were a couple people at the door waiting for tables. This place is pretty small so come earlier if you don&#39;t want to wait.\n\nWe ordered the roti pratha, corn fritters, laksa noodle soup, and singaporean curry noodles. The roti came out first and it was a delicious, doughy and crispy pancake and came with a curry dipping sauce. We finished this easily. The corn fritters came out next and that was probably my favorite appetizer. Corn is one of my favorite veggies and the fritters were so easy to eat with the sriracha aioli. The laksa was really yummy as well. The coconut curry soup seemed like it had a seafood base, and was really creamy and a little sweet. We enjoyed the egg noodles in the soup and the shrimp and bean sprouts in it. The singaporean curry noodles were flavorful, but we were pretty full from finishing the laksa already, so we took about half of it home because we couldn&#39;t finish.\n\nThe total for each person was only around $14. Not bad for all three of us full and still having a bit of leftovers!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Liked this little place!\n\nMe and my friends were looking for a quick cheap dinner and this was the place. The menu isn&#39;t super extensive, but it&#39;s enough and very cheap. The food was good enough for me (although my Malaysian friend wasn&#39;t too happy with the authenticity). Don&#39;t expect a five star treatment (you order at the counter) but service was good, food was filling, and price was cheap.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Wow, so very delicious. After my trip to Singapore last summer I&#39;ve had Laksa on the brain, and after I passed Laksa the restaurant - only to find that the restaurant with the namesake doesn&#39;t actually serve it (thanks for the warning, fellow yelpers!), I began my search to find a taste of the Singaporean treat. This place is superb and we will most definitely be back.\n\nThe server was authentically warm and friendly. The kind of warmth you rarely feel from a server - I felt like I was a guest in someone&#39;s home, it was very cozy. The restaurant only seats 24 people, and we arrived just after 6 for an early dinner on a Sunday. Just after 7 there was a small wait for a table, less than 10 minutes.\n\nThe Laksa was true to form and was easily recognizable from when I had tried it so many months ago. We also ordered the fried rice with chicken, which was especially delicious with the spicy sauce (you may need to ask for the sauce). \n\nTo finish, we had the Monkey dessert and holy buckets was that delicious. Chocolate and banana wrapped in a flaky crust with ice cream? Yes, please. I&#39;d come here just for that.\n\nDefinitely check this one out!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        A cute and fairly unnoticeable lil spot along Irving st which is led to by some descending stairs. It calls itself a Malaysian restaurant but the Malaysian me wouldn&#39;t call it the same but rather an Indonesian. This is because of some of the dishes it serves which names are never heard of in Malaysia and the funniest part is that some of these names sound funnily obscene in some Malaysian Cantonese dialects. Anyhow, the curry noodles and Murtabak are pretty good for American Asian standard. The &#34;fragrance&#34; of this place is sure to follow you and your hair home and is there to stay. I can totally understand the lovers and the haters of this place. Then again, try it out and decide for yourselves ! Terima kasih!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Stumbled upon this place while in the neighborhood and thoroughly enjoyed this hole in the wall! Food was flavorful and authentic and server suggestions were great. Managed to come in before lunch rush around 11. This restaurant has limited seating.\n\nHad the roti with meat appetizer and the laksa coconut curry noodle soup special, which was enough to share for two. Would get these again if I&#39;m back. Roti appetizer was savory and filling, and the noodle soup was warming and great for the cold climates in the Sunset. This place was a lucky find!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        You probably wouldn&#39;t think this was a restaurant if you were just passing by.. you&#39;d think it&#39;s someone&#39;s basement...haha. But it&#39;s definitely easy to spot with its lavender exterior! Parking may be difficult, you know how the city is.\n\nI really enjoyed this restaurant. It&#39;s very similar to Thai food. It was really affordable and their portions were just enough to fill two people up. We ordered their singaporean noodles based on everyone&#39;s photos on yelp, their mussels in pepper and garlic, and their panang beef. The panang beef came more in a lunch plate style as opposed to a la carte. The meat was very tender and saucy and paired really well with the rice. The mussels were considered an appetizer and I liked them a lot. The seasoning was a bit different, but very tasty. My favorite was the singaporean noodles! I am craving them right now as I type this.. iono just something about them!\n\nTotally want to come here again and try other things on the menu!\n\n**Update (couple days later)**: I would only come here for the mussels and the Singaporean noodles. Today we tried their roti prata and it was not as good as the one at Banana Island. The roti was too thick imo. Their spare ribs were not worth the $11 - cmon, 3 ribs only???\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Love this place. Authentic Singaporean food. Good quantity, non-greasy, flavorful food at very reasonable price. Cool ambiance with friendly staff/ good service. We got Singaporean glass noddles both chicken and veggie version. Both of the dishes were delicious. For appetizers we got potato cake, chicken satay, roti paratha. Everything was yummy except roti paratha curry. That was d only thing missed d mark for me. We also got chicken soup. Will definitely go back. We were 6 people and check came out around 60$.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Quick and friendly service at this unassuming Singaporean/Malaysian restaurant. In fact, we almost missed where the entrance door was haha.\n\n- Singapore curry noodles: a medium portion size, and a simple yet tasty noodle dish. No complaints here. It wasn&#39;t mind-blowing amazing, but it was decent for what curry noodles can be.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        This is my go to place for a quick take out dinner along the way home after I get off the N. I recommend the curry noodles and the fried rice. My friend reallyyyyyyy loved the noodles and one time I brought my left over fried rice to a pregame and it was a big hit. \n\nIt&#39;s also not too expensive for a good filling meal in sf. If I ever leave inner sunset, this is the place I&#39;ll miss\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Typical grungy hole in the wall, but amazing food! It was just like eating Singapore&#39;s street food. Roti, laksa, and Sinagporean noodles... drool. These are the must orders. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen many place that serve laksa so I was so happy!!\n\nThe servers here were super friendly and didn&#39;t mind at all that my friend and I sat here for an hour after finishing our food. They also checked back multiple times to refill our water.\n\nWe had a ton of leftovers afterwards... but I swear, I can eat roti and laksa forever. Also, the bathroom here is SUPER gross and smelly... so be careful.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Definitely one of my faaaavorite places to eat in the Sunset! \n\nIt&#39;s so yummy I went two weeks in a row (which is completely out of my character). \n\nLime Tree looks like it&#39;s a takeout place but I promise their food is so delish! \n\nMy favorite dishes include their roti pratha (it comes out piping hot!!) and Singaporean fried rice (ask for their chili - it makes the dish 10x better!)\n\nI&#39;ve also tried the corn fritters..which I wasn&#39;t too fond of. I prefer the roti! I&#39;ve also has the laksa, but I thought it was too creamy for my taste. \n\nNot only is their food delish, their customer service is on point! Both times I&#39;ve been here, they were super attentive. The owner (?) Aung chatted it up with my boyfriend during our meal because they&#39;re both huge apple fan boys haha. \n\nI&#39;m looking forward to trying new items on their menu when I come back!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        The place is really small and kinda dirty. Doesn&#39;t have that many choices. Overall the food doesn&#39;t taste good at all. I don&#39;t understand how can they got 4 stars reviews. Won&#39;t go back again. It&#39;s wasting money.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        This is the epitome of a hole in the wall restaurant; it&#39;s pretty hard to notice this restaurant except for its bright &#34;open&#34; sign at night! It seems to gear towards being cafe styled and doesn&#39;t have a huge selection of items to order from. HOWEVER, it still offers quite a few delicious dishes!\n\nFOOD: \n- Corn Fritters (APPETIZER): YES YES YESSSSS. My favorite!! I literally burned my tongue as I stuffed this in my mouth not realizing how hot it was. Yeah, ouch. But I got to say, it was worth it!! Reminds me of tater tots! Must try!!\n- Roti Pratha (APPETIZER): Also pretty tasty, well the curry sauce was! The roti itself was fluffy and soft, sort of like soft bread. It&#39;s not crispy though but still, YUM! \n- Nasi Goreng: It&#39;s fried rice with chicken or shrimp. I definitely recommend this dish!! Something about this tastes unique, not quite sure what sauce is used to cook this but it tastes a bit like its cooked with garlic. HUGE portion too!\n- Singaporean curry noodle: This was alright, not amazing but pretty decent! Add a hint of lime accordingly and it will taste even better. Mmm! \n\nThe total came out to be $32 without tips, pretty affordable if you ask me! They also give you a few slices of oranges for dessert (better not nothing, right?). Great service too! Super quick in ordering and delivering our food!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        summary: Good portion sizes, good flavors, and fairly cheap--especially if split between several people. Mostly carb-ful dishes on the menu but service is friendly and fast. I wasn&#39;t blown away to the point where I&#39;d come back. \n\nthe experience: I went with 3 other people, ordered the roti pratha and martabak which were both tasty and simple--nothing amazing but good starters.  We also ordered the shrimp and mushroom glass noodle and one of the chicken rice dishes. Both were not too try-hard (in appearance and flavor) and had a good mix of savory textures. The chicken dish had some dried garlic crunchies and a sweet peanutyness to it but was thankfully not too overwhelming or clash-y (I personally don&#39;t like foods like pad thai that mix sweet and savory flavors together). My fav was the shrimp noodles which had garlic and chives that were very well mixed into the noodles so it didn&#39;t taste too much like add-ons. The noodles were easy to handle and pretty cut up so I didn&#39;t drop my nooders everywhere.\n\nbut note: it&#39;s located sort of in a basement so you can look up to people staring down at you from the windows. The forks we had were sorta sticky but nbd. Half-way through drinking up my water, I noticed weird black specks stuck to the bottom of water cup that detached upon swirling--unsure what it was but I&#39;m not dead yet!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        I was excited to eat laksa here - one of my new obsessions post-HK trip. Luckily, it was one of the daily specials, along with salmon steamed in banana leaf.\n\nMy companion, who had never had Malaysian food before, loved both items, especially the laksa. I was more lukewarm. The laksa was tasty, but heavy on the coconut milk, though the shrimp were particularly fresh and the noodles quite snappy. I found the spices on the salmon to be really unique - lemongrass-heavy but not just that - but they overcooked the meat to a strawy mass on the outsides.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        I can&#39;t believe I haven&#39;t written a review of this place yet. Lime Tree is a hidden gem in the inner sunset area, which already has a ton of great options for food. But my oh my. It has all the staples of an Indonesian restaurant you would need\n\nSome favorites:\n\n- Roti Pratha: light and fluffy with a nice crisp texture. They come out piping hot with a nice curry dipping sauce\n- Corn fritters: subtle sweetness from the corn and a very satisfying crunch\n- Singaporean noodles: not the most groundbreaking dish you&#39;ll have but it really hits the spot.\n- Laksa: coconut base soup full of veggies and shrimp and delicious rice noodles. Probably my favorite entree\n\nThe best part? It&#39;s. So. Affordable. And it hits the spot and you leave happy :)\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        All of the reviews already posted for this place are really great and descriptive so I will only add two things:\n\n1) The Martabak sounds way better on paper than it tastes! Don&#39;t bother with it.\n\n2) If you happen to be East African and are looking for a way to get chapati without making it yourself just grab a bunch of this Roti. It&#39;s expensive but damn, it tastes exactly like the chapati we eat at home in Tanzania -- love it!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Awesome food, quick service, well priced, and fun to eat something that is reminiscent of Thai and other south Asian food but also incorporates unfamiliar flavors and combinations. This will become a regular in our casual dinner lineup. I just can&#39;t believe it took me 1.5 years to make it here!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        My friends and I decided to come here because they wanted to try this place since this restaurant recommended to them. We came here maybe 30-45 minutes before closing so we were kind of rushed but that was given. \n\nLime Tree is a small little spot for simple Southeast Asian food. It could get really busy (we got lucky) and it would be almost cramped. But aside from that, the menu is simple and we decided pretty quickly. We got the laksa, shrimp glass noodles, and nasi goreng. The food came out pretty quickly, and the service was good. The food were good and my two Singaporean friends approved, at least for the laksa. I really thoroughly enjoyed the food here. The laksa was very tasty and flavorful. The nasi goreng was also good, too. I didn&#39;t like the shrimp noodles too much and it just wasn&#39;t really my cup of tea. \n\nOverall, I did enjoy the food here and would recommend trying this place. The food is good, it&#39;s at a good price and service is friendly and quick.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        I had the mie tek tek. \nit was pretty average.\nthere are better place for south east asian kitchen.\n    \n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        \n\n            \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            Lime Tree Southeast Asian Kitchen", "url": "/biz/lime-tree-southeast-asian-kitchen-san-francisco", "hours": "Mon                    Closed                                                                Tue                    11:00 am - 3:00 pm5:00 pm - 9:30 pm                                                                                Wed                    11:00 am - 3:00 pm5:00 pm - 9:30 pm                                                                Thu                    11:00 am - 3:00 pm5:00 pm - 9:30 pm                                                                Fri                    11:00 am - 3:00 pm5:00 pm - 9:30 pm                                                                Sat                    12:00 pm - 9:30 pm                                                                Sun                    12:00 pm - 9:00 pm", "tele": "(415) 665-1415", "address": "450 Irving StSan Francisco, CA 94122", "imageList": ["https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/JgDMSc1IL6cHOxPhrBPZ7g/ls.jpg", "c93fadff5c43b5a5b78840bf45c5e436.jpg"], "type": "Singaporean,\n                    Malaysian,\n                    Indonesian"}
{"title": "div itemprop=\"review\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Review\">\n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        This is such a great place to bring out-of-town friends visiting San Francisco! Although the wait is super long, I&#39;ve use the divide and conquer tactic by assigning one person to wait in the line (me) while visiting friends get to wander around the Ferry Building and explore. They have an amazing hostess who just absolutely rocks! She understands that folks have been waiting over an hour in line and works hard to get people seated as quickly as possible. \n\nThe food is what you expect fresh seafood to taste like. Absolutely delicious! We went for lunch and everything was great from the service to the food. Our table ordered half a dozen sweetwater oysters - super fresh and sweet and the tabasco with the sauce compliments the oysters so well! We also ordered the fried oyster kale caesar salad, fried anchovies, mussels, and rustic seafood stew. They also serve bread and butter when your party first sits down - make sure not to eat too much of this tasty bread so you&#39;re not too full for the meal!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Love this place! From the food to drinks to scenery! My boyfriend and I came in the evening and sat outside on the patio, where you could see the bridge light up in a distance and water surrounding it.. Sighhh it was so romantic.. Loved it... \n\nWe came on a weekday and the wait was only about 5mins for outdoor seating. We didn&#39;t mind at all. It was more chill and quiet outside anyways. Inside was very busy and chatty. \n\nThe oysters were aahhmaaazzingg!! Soo fresh and juicy and sweet! Oh man I could eat them for days! Also, the clam chowder was sooo good!!! Real shelled clams in a hearty broth on a chilly night with my baby was magical! Haha Use the bread that they give you at the beginning to dip in the clam chowder you won&#39;t be sorry! Yumm...\n\nI def recommend this place if you&#39;re ever in town! Have a seat outside on the patio for a more intimate time and wonderful scenery.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Don&#39;t think I need to review this place since the amount of traffic speaks for itself.\n\nThe hog island oysters are definitely one of the best I&#39;ve tried. The clam chowder is unique to the restaurant, it&#39;s unlike the typical thick chowder where this is more soupy but still creamy with fresh clams and some bacons and potato. I like this version way better.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        After an awesome afternoon touring Alcatraz (note: it&#39;s a long walk, but totally doable! It&#39;s worth it, promise.), we decided to head over to Hog Island for happy hour. But to our disappointment, they no longer offer it. But nevertheless, it didn&#39;t damper our our evening and was determined to get our oyster fix. \n\nLucky for us, we were seated next to the kitchen so we got to see all the food coming out! Every dish that came out looked delicious.\n\nFood:\n6 Oysters $18 5/5\nWe were able to choose half Hog Island (CA) and half Henderson (WA). Between the two, we definitely enjoyed the Hog Island oysters more as they were meatier and plump.\n\nGrilled Oysters $14 5/5\nAn order comes with 4 grilled oysters. Available today, we chose the Chipotle flavored. It was slightly smokey and buttery good! Make sure you save some bread for sopping. Just wish there were more! \n\nLittle Neck Clams $2 each 5/5\nIf you never had clams on the half shell, this is the place to try as it was so fresh and delicious! Not sure if this makes sense, but it was very clean tasting. \n\nChowder $14 4/5\nThey only offer this in a bowl, which is great for sharing. The soup wasn&#39;t as thick as I would have liked, but the flavor and creaminess was great. Definitely loved the presentation as they included a generous amount of clams in the shell. Remember to save some bread for this! \n\nAlthough a bit expensive, the seafood was super fresh and we all very much enjoyed it. Will definitely come back next time I&#39;m in town!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        A year or two ago, I was able to attend a private event where they offered all you can eat oysters from Hog Island Oyster Co., and I have been obsessed ever since. Sadly, I did not get a chance to visit an actual Hog Island location until recently, and boy did it not disappoint!\n\nHog Island is a bit on the pricey side, but what can you expect from the Ferry Building? And on top of that, /because/ it&#39;s the Ferry Building, you absolutely need to make sure to show up early (~30 minutes before opening) to guarantee seating within an acceptable wait time. Staff/service was quick, efficient, and very nice. \n\nIf you&#39;re not getting oysters, you&#39;re missing out. Actually if you&#39;re not getting oysters, why are you even here??? Although their other food is fantastic, oysters is just so clearly the star menu item. Enjoy at least half a dozen! The oysters come with this fantastic cilantro/vinegar sauce (which I totally accidentally inhaled and almost died choking from but whatever, still worth it LOL) and I can&#39;t speak enough to how good those Hog Island oysters are.   \n\nGreat, now I&#39;m craving them again. \n\nOther than the oysters, my friend and I each enjoyed a nice, refreshing seasonal cocktail. My friend got the clam chowder, which she said was really good but a little too creamy, whereas I enjoyed the fried oyster po&#39;boy (if not clear before, I really enjoy oysters). Fries came with a nice coating of Old Bay seasoning, which is another one of my favorite types of fries. \n\nOverall, 5/5. I would take anyone who comes to visit me here.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        I got a lot of recommendations for places to eat in SF, but only one single place was recommended to me by multiple friends who all have different tastes in food: Hog Island Oyster Company. &#34;Go to the Ferry Building&#34;, they told me, &#34;and eat oysters and be happy.&#34;\n\nDespite the hype? Despite the lines? Despite the tourists?\nYes. Go.\n\nSo I went. And I want to give a shout-out to the hostess who seated me at the bar and then kept the seat next to me open for over an hour because I had no idea when my boyfriend would be released from work and able to join me. \n\nWhile I waited, I ordered the clam chowder, which several of my friends recommended in addition to the namesake oysters. It came out REALLY fast, because they are just constantly cooking this chowder as I could see sitting in front of that particular part of the kitchen.\n\nIt was also the best clam chowder I&#39;ve ever had. The flavors were phenomenal, and I actually quite liked that it wasn&#39;t thick like New England-style chowder tends to be. It was a great stew, awesome for dipping my bread in, and I just... man, how am I supposed to eat clam chowder anywhere else now???\n\nThe oysters were also really yummy. They didn&#39;t have quite the same impact on me as the chowder (I was also less hangry by the time I was slurping them down), but they were delicious. If you have your heart set on specific oysters, you&#39;ll want to check because they do offer different oysters every day depending on what they have and what&#39;s fresh. \n\nWhile I ate, I watched the cooks grill a bunch of oysters in front of me, and the dungeness crab was very popular as it was the end of the season. Everything looked and smelled really delicious and everybody looked really happy with their meals. The prices are on the steeper side but with this level of hype, you have to expect that.\n\nTL;DR\n+ Delicious clam chowder, $14 price tag\n+ Great oysters\n+ Expect lines but not a crowd (hence lines)\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Hog Island used to be one of my faves for lunch and it has been awhile since I last visited.  \n\nUnderstanding menu changes all the time but I was disappointed that they no longer have the uni dip that I loved.  \n\nAlso, the mussels is the one dish I always get every time, in fact,  it was so good all three of us ordered the same thing because we didn&#39;t want to share with each other! Thinking on how good it was, we even ordered the grilled cheese sandwich instead of their complimentary acme epi so we could dipped into the broth, but to our disappointments, Hog changed how the dish was cooked from a kind of coconut curry&#39;ish broth to a water down tomato&#39;ish broth that didn&#39;t have much flavor to it.  We were so sad!\n\nOn the other hand, their raw oysters were very fresh albeit a few were on the skinny side.  Couple others were plump and juicy and tasted like the ocean.  \n\n3.5 stars.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        I&#39;ve been to all 3 locations for Hog Island and each place I&#39;ve been to doesn&#39;t disappoint. The oysters are always fresh and oh so tasty! Their vinaigrette they include with the oysters is so good. My husband and I always get the clam chowder and grilled cheese (I know ... but carbs and bread, yes please). I&#39;ve also had their BBQ oysters and those are definitely different but very good. I&#39;ve had the chipotle bourbon and I really enjoy those. You really can&#39;t go wrong with anything on the menu.\n\nThe SF location is the only spot that does hard drinks. The Marshall and Napa locations are beer and wine only. They don&#39;t do reservations which is a bummer since they&#39;re always busy but if you go right when they open or in between meals you&#39;re usually safe. \n\nHighly recommend any of the hog island locations!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        I first learned about Hog Island through Martha Stewart.  She did a show where she plucked the oyster from the bay, shucked it and ate it all while still standing in the water.  New line on bucket list was created.\n\nYears ago, I stumbled into Hog Island at the Ferry Building, but 8 years later, was it still the same?\n\nThere was a short line on an early Tuesday evening,  but grabbed a glass of Sancerre to sip while standing in line.  After 2 sips, I was seated in one of the bar style seats where you watch the cooks at work.  \n\nServer immediately brought me water, bread &amp; butter while I perused the menu.  Of course, a round of oysters were in order.  But I also had to get that fresh AK Halibut the cooks were grilling.\n\nOysters?  Perfect.  Had the sweetwater which were smaller and had the right balance of brine.\nHalibut?  Perfect.  Light crisp on the outside and fresh.\n\nServer was friendly &amp; attentive.  \n\nStill haven&#39;t plucked and shucked while standing in the bay, but one day...\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        This is by far the best place to get oysters. I am an oyster addict, and have tried oysters far and wide, but none compare to the ones here at Hog Island (5/5). I&#39;ve also been to their oyster farm out in Tomales Bay and learned to shuck oysters so I could buy these little suckers at the farmers market for cheap. However, my favorite thing about eating oysters at the restaurant is the mignonette - you can&#39;t really eat oysters the same way without these. Hog Island is a San Francisco classic. If you haven&#39;t eaten here, have you really been to SF?\n\n[Food]\nMy favorite thing to do is to order a 24 plater of the Hog Island Sweetwaters (no other types of oysters compare), Old Bay Fries, and a Pilsner beer on a Saturday afternoon. The oysters are always perfectly shucked and you don&#39;t have to worry about swallowing shell. Even though I rarely try new things at Hog Island, my new favorite discovery has been the large grilled oysters here - the Chimichurri! Would highly recommend ordering these. I&#39;ve also tried the Seafood stew, and would recommend! They give you a lot of seafood and aren&#39;t playing around. The grilled cheese is also amazing.\n\n[Drinks]\nThe Bloody Mary here is amazing! If you&#39;re waiting in line (which typically happens), its best to order a drink and look on the great view of the Bay Bridge. Otherwise, order a Pilsner. You can&#39;t really go wrong.\n\n[Service]\nService isn&#39;t outstanding given the volume of customers that go through and the need to be efficient. However, I&#39;ve always found the host/hostess and servers to be friendly and they start to recognize you after you go 2 times a week when you&#39;re really going through an oyster craze. Seriously, if you haven&#39;t had Hog Island, did you even visit SF?\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        I came here for the first time on a Thursday at 5:30. I had to park a couple blocks down on metered street parking at $3.50 an hour before 7pm and only 50 cents an hour after that. It was the cheaper alternative to parking in one of the lots at 15 to 20 bucks per car.  The wait was not long at all and we were seated in about 15 minutes. We were greeted by the hostess with small talk while walking us to our table and he was very nice. \n\nAs soon as we were seated, Ben B. our server asked what we would like to drink and brought out our drinks promptly along with delicious bread and butter. He was very informative and willing to answer any questions we had about the menu. Ben also gave us his recommendations which we followed and the food was excellent!\n\nFirst off the oysters are great, probably the best I&#39;ve had and I order oysters quiet often. We ordered 2 dozen mixed variety of oysters although our favorite was the Hog island Sweetwaters. They oysters come with a few slices of lemon and this wonderful chimichurri sauce (use sparingly, will over power the oysters)\n\nWe ordered the clam chowder which Ben offered to split the bowl for us to share. The clam chowder is not as thick as I am use to, but the flavor is great. It comes with potatoes, carrots, bacon, and a HEFTY portion of Manila clams!\n\nUpon finishing our chowder, Ben brought out our main dishes. What made this experience unforgettable was the fact that once our food came out, I had to run back to the car to put more time into our meter and while I was gone, Ben first had offered to bring out new fries so they would be hot when I got back and a few minutes later he actually took my whole plate back to bring me out a new plate when I got back. Although I was okay with my food being cold, he took the initiative to make sure I received my food hot and I truly appreciated that. \n\nWe ordered the grilled cheese which came in sliced in fours. The cheese mixture was absolutely delicious... I know.. it&#39;s just grilled cheese, but if you order it then you&#39;ll know exactly what I&#39;m talking about. It also comes with a small salad which was also very tasty\n\nI also ordered the fried oyster po-boy. The oysters were fried in corn meal giving it a little grainy texture. It lays on top of a tasty coleslaw in between a buttery bun. It is also complemented with a side of seasoned fries and you can&#39;t go wrong if order this.\n\nWhen we received our bill, Ben had complemented my meal, which was totally unexpected. You can bet he got a great tip from us for being so personable, attentive, and for his excellent customer service! Ben is the reason I give this establishment the 5 star rating. Thank you Ben for making our first experience here the best!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Both of my friends have been here a few times and they recommended the clam chowder. This was my first time  coming here and I was feeling a sandwich. They had a few sandwiches to pick from but I ended up with the oyster sandwich with a side of fries! Both of my friends got the clam chowders!\n\nSandwich: it was pretty good. The oyster were perfectly seasoned and crispy. The slaw that came with it compliment the oysters well. The fries that comes with the sandwich was also crispy and well seasoned.\n\nClam chowder: I did try my friend clam chowder and it was amazing. It was different than other clam chowder that I had. It was less thick and the broth had a flavor of the clams and the potatoes, and other vegetables. They sure do give you a lot of clams though! I think one of my friends had like 20 clams in her soup.\n\nThis is a nice place to sit outside and enjoy the view. You have the bay bridge and nice ocean breeze. \n\nThe wait was typical and kind of fast for such a busy place. We waited about 30mins to get seated for lunch on a Sunday.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        BEST CLAM CHOWDER I&#39;VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE.\n\nThis is in a GREAT location in the Ferry Building. You can take Bart to Embarcadero and it&#39;s right there! \n\nI&#39;ve only been here twice. The first time I went, we tried the oysters and the clam chowder. To be honest, I&#39;m not much of an oyster person, but these oysters were SO GOOD. They give all the right condiments to go with it, they are fresh, and they aren&#39;t as slimy as other oysters I&#39;ve had. It tastes like it came straight from the ocean water, which is a good thing! I think I&#39;d only eat oysters from here. It is a bit pricey but honestly, in my opinion, you get what you pay for: high quality.\n\nAs for the clam chowder, WOW. It isn&#39;t your typical thick chowder and it definitely isn&#39;t your typical Fishermans Wharf chowder. The broth is delicate but rich. It&#39;s so buttery and delicious. The clams are so fresh and meaty, and they give you so much! It comes with hearty potatoes and pieces of thick bacon. It is seriously the best clam chowder I&#39;ve ever had and I can never have clam chowder anywhere else. It&#39;s THAT good.\n\nThey also give FREE BREAD! The clam chowder with the bread is a heavenly meal, definitely ask for more bread! It absorbs the soup so well!\n\nI&#39;ve tried cocktails here too, and they are good! They make them strong, so get more bread to soak it all up!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        This is my go-to place whenever I&#39;m craving seafood. Their food is always up to par with my expectations and although their lines are usually out the door, it&#39;s always worth the wait!\n\nI typically order A LOT of oysters and get pretty good ones but this time was unfortunately the opposite. I forgot the name of the ones we ordered but we couldn&#39;t finish it because it was just too briny for my taste. Also, they were medium sized and I like the smaller ones better. Oh well, live and learn.\n\nGumbo--oh my...this was amazing. Lots of seafood. Lots of that gumbo flavor and seasoning you would expect from a really good gumbo. Simple but amazing.\n\nClam chowder--this was my first time trying a clam chowder that&#39;s a loose chowder liquid form (sorry, did not know how to explain that properly) but it was absolutely amazing. Perfect taste and lots of clams on the shell. \n\nGrilled cheese--I guess we could have skipped this one. Basic grilled cheese but still tasty. \n\n\nAt this point, we were STUFFED. Note that this was shared between two people.\nHog island never disappoints! Can&#39;t wait to come back next time I&#39;m in NorCal.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        If there was one resto I would recommend during my stay in SF, Hog Island would be it. Unpretentious fresh out of water seafood was just what I needed and expected from this high profile city surrounded by a sparkling bay.\n\nBe prepared for a wait but it will be well worth it. We came while the weather was rainy but I can already imagine how nice this would be during a sunny day with great views, chilled oysters and a nice cold beer.\n\nHighly recommend the Harstine oysters - so fatty, fresh and juicy, I could have eaten a dozen of those myself. The rustic seafood stew was also super on point and had all the right elements of fresh fish and shellfish finished in a spicy herb-tomato broth.. we licked the bowl clean. They also had lots of specials on the menu which offered a variety of best in season options - don&#39;t think you can really go wrong. \n\nOverall, I liked how it was simple preparation for everything but they let the fresh ingredients speak for themselves and it really delivered. Their 4+ rating seems justified imo.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        This place exemplifies seafood on another level. While I would say the Oysters were very good and great for someone visiting SF for the first time, the clam chowder was hardcore. This clam chowder was not your typical walk around the pier; it was the epitome of seafood concoctions and what the definition of clam chowder should be.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Great place to grab some food and slurp on some delicious creamy oysters. Came here on three separate occasions and every time was better than the last! First visit, the bf and I sat at their outside patio. Although windy, it wasn&#39;t unpleasantly cold cause of the heat lamps above our heads. On our most recent visit, we sat at the oyster bar. This was our favorite spot for two reasons. (1) the beautiful window view of the bridge and the pier. That specific day, it rained so by the time we got seated, the sky had cleared and a rainbow had appeared. The view was simply beautiful to say the least! (2) it was really nice sitting in front of all the oysters being shucked. The bf struck up a conversation with the man shucking and he recommended us the Chelsea oysters which turned out to be our favorite! Thank you oyster bar guy ^___^ \n\nO Y S T E R S:\n\n- HAMA OLYMPIA (2 for $7): so cute and tiny but very fresh &amp; creamy! Literally the cutest chubby baby oysters. Tasted sweet also. \n- CHELSEA (6 for $18): our favorite!! Very creamy and big. We loved how the oyster shell had a huge pocket so it kept all the juices! \n- BAR MIX (12 for $38): Every piece was nicely sized. None of the oysters had a fishy seawater taste. Paired with their cilantro vinaigrette, lemon, and tobacco sauce was delicious! \n\nF O O D: \n\n- CHOWDER ($14): creamy and flavorful. Consists of Manila clams, veggies, bacon, potatoes, and cream. I personally really enjoyed this dish and I loved dipping my bread in the sauce. Perfect for a cold day. \n- STEAMERS ($17): had a spicy kick to the dish which I loved. Consists of Manila clams, jalape\u00f1os sausage, kale, roasted jalape\u00f1o butter, white wine, and onion. \n- SEAFOOD STEW ($24): recommended to us by our waitress, Laura. This stew had A LOT of calamari. So much we couldn&#39;t finish it. Besides calamari, there was octopus, baby clams, and mussels bathed in a tomato oregano broth. The stew also came with two acme levain toast which paired nicely with the soup. \n- OLD BAY FRIES ($4): crispy Cajun French fries. \n- OYSTER PO BOY SANDWICH ($16): the bf said this was alright. \n\nS E R V I C E:\nOur waitress on our third visit, Laura, was very outspoken, funny, and attentive. I was pretty indecisive at first but her honest opinions helped me decide on a few dishes and oysters and we liked them all. She checked in regularly and even secretly placed a bread on my empty plate without my knowledge! Lol.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Ohhhhh yeah! Hog Island is a gem tucked away in the Ferry Building, and an awesome place for a killer lunch. It&#39;s not cheap but I can almost guarantee you&#39;ll like it. \n\nEven though you can see Hog Island from inside that market in the Ferry Building, you will need to line up on the pier outside to be seated by the hostess. (Why they do this IDK, but just go with it!) They get really busy around lunch time so come early or be prepared to wait. \n\nOysters are obviously the name of the game here (though there is plenty on the menu if they&#39;re not your fave, and I&#39;ll readily admit I&#39;m not a huge fan). You can order them grilled, fried, etc. I REALLY liked the Sriracha / lime juice grilled oysters I tried - four for $14. (Sorry, can&#39;t recall which variety they were!) \n\nI also had to spring for the clam chowder ($14) and didn&#39;t regret it, though I will warn you I watched them make it from my seat at the bar and it&#39;s like 80% cream. Delicious...but dangerous for anyone a little sensitive to dairy...or dieting!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        My friends arrived around 10:40am on a Saturday, when it opens at 11am, and there was already a line! I guess that shows how popular this spot is!\n\nWe ordered a dozen Hog Island oysters to share amongst the 4 of us. Each oyster was $3, which is a bit expensive, but they were super fresh! I don&#39;t usually like oysters, but these were mouthwateringly delicious! I also greatly enjoyed the clam chowder, which was super milky though not thick like usual chowder. The mussels with fries were also amazing! I&#39;ve heard good things about the grilled cheese, but at its price point, it wasn&#39;t mind-blowing. \n\nService and location are great. You get that gorgeous Bay Bridge view regardless of inside or outside seating. They do not take reservations so make sure to get there early. Friends, great food, and views? I&#39;ll be back for sure!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        This was a much anticipated first visit to hog island oyster co. We decided to go for an early lunch on a weekday to avoid the tourist crowd. I finally understand why the line is so long and slow - the inside of the restaurant is very small with communal tables or bar seating. \n\nDelicious acme bread kept us happy while we looked through the menu. We ordered a dozen mixed oysters, the fried shrimp and lingcod sliders with a dry cider. The fried shrimp were full bodies meant to be eaten w shell... yuck, I just can&#39;t eat a shrimp with a face, so I peeled and settled to refrain from the proper eating method.\n    \n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        \n\n            \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            Hog Island Oyster Co", "url": "/biz/hog-island-oyster-co-san-francisco", "hours": "Mon                    11:00 am - 9:00 pm                                                                Tue                    11:00 am - 9:00 pm                                                                                Wed                    11:00 am - 9:00 pm                                                                Thu                    11:00 am - 9:00 pm                                                                Fri                    11:00 am - 9:00 pm                                                                Sat                    11:00 am - 9:00 pm                                                                Sun                    11:00 am - 9:00 pm", "tele": "(415) 391-7117", "address": "1 Ferry BldgShop 11San Francisco, CA 94111", "imageList": ["https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6mESFYWgHf7NKCvm2rEDjw/ls.jpg", "6416114b3a0e865c229d24675d8c938c.jpg"], "type": "Seafood,\n                    Seafood Markets,\n                    Live/Raw Food"}

{"title": "div itemprop=\"review\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Review\">\n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        First time, so very good. Staff was incredibly nice and welcoming. My girlfriend NEVER eats fish, tried a bite of the cod in my fish &amp; chips... ended up eating HALF! \nWould definitely recommend. Try the fish &amp; chips and the garlic fries \n\nWe will be back\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        The food is a standard fish and chips dish.\nNothing special, tastes ok.\nFrench fries was overcooked, also they seem to use frozen potato fries as I have noticed black spots on the potato.\nConsidering that you suppose to eat this dish with hands, they didn&#39;t have any wet napkins or sanitizer.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Cute outdoor seating area and decent fish and chips, but after recently visiting another seafood joint, this place was slightly less enjoyable than the other seafood joint we tried.  \n\nJunior fish was a good sized piece of fish, but cans of soda are $2!  Definitely better than most places on the wharf, but the chips were soggy.  Would love to have crispy chips/fries.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        This is supposed to be one of the most popular places for Fish and Chips at Fisherman Wharf but it was a disappointment for us. First they didn&#39;t give us chips, those were fries. Second It was like too much flour on the fish (check the photos), plus the fries were salty and the rest of the food was missing salt. We won&#39;t be back.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        I&#39;m surprised by the ratings and the number of reviews of this place. I would definitely say that this is a tourist spot and I would not come here again. This place is located near Fisherman&#39;s Wharf and attracts many people for its great location. However, the taste of the food is mediocre.\n\nWe ordered the Fish and Chips as everyone else does. The batter on the fish had a great texture and the fish was moist but there was no flavor. It needed some salt or some sort of spice to actually make it taste like something. The fries were so starchy and potato-y that I didn&#39;t even want to finish them. For $11, you get 2 pieces of fish and French fries. Definitely not worth it.\n\nOverall, avoid this spot if you can. I didn&#39;t enjoy any of the food I had. It&#39;s cheaper than the places around it, but you&#39;re better off spending more for a yummier meal!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        I love food that is seasoned with salt, pepper,  herbs and spices... if you don&#39;t like that this is the perfect fish and shrimp place. The fish and shrimp were fresh but the batter was not seasoned at all. Had the crazy fries would have been good if they warmed the crazy sauce... warm fries and cold sauce...the sauce for the fries was good especially the fresh garlic...just wish it was served warm\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Consider this a Batter and chips spot. And I am not saying that because I ran into Hunter Pence but rather because the fish is hardly tasted. That&#39;s all there is to justifying the 2.\n\nNow some ideas as to why it&#39;s rated as high as it is...\n\nThe trailers cuteness? The prime location?\n\nThe &#34;how was everything&#34; that the owner swings your way will probably get you to label the meal as coming with good service.\n\nThe rating with the amount of reviews might get your taste buds to conform into thinking it&#39;s great.\n\nThe owners British accent may fool you into thinking this spot is as authentic as it gets\n\nOr maybe...it&#39;s just me\n\nAnd after all that...\n\nThe Codmother is still worth visiting, under 15$ is the cost for sharing a reasonable portion with whoever you&#39;re in SF with. Not a bad price for you to find out what the hype is all about...or in my case...what it&#39;s not about. \n\nSide notes: \n\nTheir shrimp was nothing past what I could find at a cheap street stop near the oceanic shores of Baja. \n\nChips...they&#39;re there.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        We were looking for a place in fisherman&#39;s warf to grab a bite to eat and yelp steered us to the codmother fish and chips. Honestly, I don&#39;t get the appeal. I ordered just the fish and it came with a salad and tartar sauce. It tasted like the frozen fish I get from trader joe&#39;s - although we were told the owner uses some special recipe from their grandmother. Don&#39;t get me wrong, my fish wasn&#39;t bad, it just wasn&#39;t anything amazing - and it was pretty expensive. The restaurant is  more like a food truck so there are no bathrooms. You have to walk blocks away to use the public restroom. I&#39;d say skip it.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Yummy fish tacos, but not amazing (missing cheese and the option to add guac). \n\nPretty cheap for SF standards ($6.99 for two fish tacos).\n\nService was friendly and fast.\n\nEating area is outside, great for a sunny day. I&#39;ll probably be back if I&#39;m in the neighborhood.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Found this place on trip advisor as one of the top places to eat in SF.  We came here at lunchtime on a Wednesday. It wasn&#39;t to crowded and we found bench seating pretty easily.  The menu is simple fish and shrimp either with chips or in tacos.  The lady at the counter has a pretty thick British accent so she seemed to have a hard time with a lot of people&#39;s orders  the food was otherwise was pretty good, nothing to die for!! But worth the try if you haven&#39;t had it.  The fish is nicely breaded and fried to a nice crisp and the meat is soft!! The shrimp is a nice size with same breaking.  I suggest you get the combo to have both! The Baja tacos where okay I live in San Diego nothing beats our tacos down there!!  Overall 4 stars I like this mom n pop chain!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Best fish and chips I have ever had! The fish is juicy and the batter is light and crispy. The baja sauce was kind of interesting but I probably wouldn&#39;t get it again. It tastes somewhat like a creamy salsa. I&#39;ll stick with the tartar sauce from now on. \n\nP.S. Beware of the pigeons while eating here, they are fearless and will try to attack you while you eat.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        My favorite touristy place to take friends visiting the city who drag me to Fisherman&#39;s Wharf. Can be kind of hard to find. It&#39;s around the corner from the other food stands/truckesque nonsense. Parking&#39;s hard to find, go figure. But you might get lucky. \n\nLimited seating, all outdoor. They specialize in cod and they do it pretty darn well. Everyone who works here is absolutely hilarious, British, and extremely friendly. They spend a lot of time with tourists and they know how to charm their customers. \n\nThe fish is still absolutely delicious, and it&#39;s been maybe four years since the last time I&#39;ve had it. The fried batter and the most tender cod inside it. If you love fish and chips, this place doesn&#39;t disappoint. The only thing that disappoints is when your stomach is too full to finish the rest of your fish and chips order. That and the salt overload that&#39;s making you craving a bucket of water. Every time I come here I make the mistake of ordering too much. What can I say- my eyes are bigger than my stomach.\n\nIf you&#39;re in Fisherman&#39;s Wharf, go ahead and try The Codmother.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Stopped by for a late lunch after a nice stairway walk (stairway walks in San Francisco book....check it out!!).  This location is a permanent food truck on the corner, across from Holiday Inn, with a cute street side, fenced patio.  No line, easy ordering. Tried the combo (fish, shrimp) platter, which did don&#39;t disappoint. Large, fresh shrimp and fresh large chunk of fish deep fried in a nice batter.  Fries were fresh cut, think and nice and hot.  For  $13 and some change, it was good value for the area.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        I wanted to give this place a shot based on the large quantity of excellent reviews. They did not disappoint! After a long walk up three 40 degree inclines to see the crooked street, this was a most welcome reprieve. It&#39;s a food truck with a small enclosed dining area mostly covered by table umbrellas. You order at the window, pay, and wait for your number to be called. We ordered a 3 piece fish with fully loaded chips and some fish tacos. The order came out fairly quickly and looked amazing. The fish were large, the fry basket massive and covered in their Baja sauce, and 2 packed fish tacos. The fish was perfectly fried with the proper amount of breading. They serve everything with their Baja sauce and tartar sauce. Hubs said it was the best fish and chips he&#39;s ever had, and that&#39;s his go-to order!.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Mother of cod this place is good -- it&#39;s really a food truck and not really a &#39;place.&#39; This is now the second time I&#39;ve been to codmother. The first time was with my mom&#39;s college roommate, you might even say close enough to be a godmother. \n\nThe highlight of this place obviously is the fish. The breading is pretty thick and the inside of the fish is so perfectly juicy and tender, probably the best fish n chips you can get almost anywhere. I&#39;ll definitely keep coming back to codmother when I get a chance \n\nI haven&#39;t really tried any of the crazy fries, but I&#39;d recommend just going for that classic fish n chips, the fries are really an afterthought and not really needed because the meal is already so heavy. \n\nThe only downside is that it takes a little bit of time, I waited for about 12 minutes for my fish n chips, which is pretty standard.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Amazing. Staff was friendly, food was fantastic. Try the junior fish and add shrimp if you can&#39;t decide!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        I really hope this place expands, because they know what they&#39;re doing! You won&#39;t have any regrets by giving them a go. My only disappointment is that I couldn&#39;t fit more than a fish and chips basket in my belly. I really wanted to try one of their fried Snickers. They certainly know how to fry stuff... like, so well that I want to go back to San Fran just to eat here again, and I live in Texas! I&#39;ve had fish and chips in England, B.C., and a number of top spots here in Austin, and nothing compares. Please please please considering opening a food truck in Austin. I&#39;ll love you forever!!!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        What I liked:\n\n--Staff was super friendly and very helpful when describing the menu items. Food was made to order and prepared in under 10 minutes.\n\n--Baja Sauce on the fish tacos should be bottled and sold in every store on earth.\n\n--The food was reasonably priced and the portions were large. No skimping here.\n\nWhat I wasn&#39;t crazy about:\n\n--Do you really need the large sign at the register that says &#34;We have the right to refuse any customer&#34; That felt very unwelcoming to me. \n\n--Ok, you serve fried fish as your specialty and do not offer beer as a beverage. Beer and fried fish may be the most necessary combination of items on earth.\n\n--No fresh lemon for the fried fish?? No lime wedges for the fish tacos?? Sheesh..\n\n--Since there was no acid for the fish dishes (besides malt vinegar), the outside batter tasted very heavy and a little greasy. I could only eat half of the fish, although the cod inside was moist and flavorful. Tartar sauce was also very heavy/rich and missing acid. Not a fan of dipping greasy fish into tartar sauce that has way too much mayo.\n\n---Lots of birds in the dining area looking for scraps.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        It&#39;s a touristy food truck.  Good fish and chips.  Outdoor seating could be bigger, but I don&#39;t think they can help with that.  \nThe Codmother became my go to place whenever I host friends or relatives who are out of town.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        I can understand why this place had such good ratings! Delicious fish and chips. Though for me, there are caveats.\n\nThe fried fish was delicious. Battered crispy and fresh, the fish comes out still hot from being fried, and is very tender. With the tartar sauce, or the Baja sauce, it is really delicious. For me, the batter was on just a little bit thick, but that was no problem. The fish overall was awesome.\n\nThe fries on the other hand... pretty disappointing. The fries themselves were good but not great. I love fries that are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I felt like they were neither. But the worst part is that I added $2 to get garlic fries, and basically they just dumped a little bit of diced garlic onto the fries. They weren&#39;t even tossed together. The garlic was uncooked and raw/spicy and the fries did not taste good with it. Meh, not ideal and a waste of my money (both in value and taste)\n    \n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        \n\n            \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            The Codmother Fish and Chips", "url": "/biz/the-codmother-fish-and-chips-san-francisco", "hours": "Mon                    11:30 am - 5:00 pm                                                                Tue                    11:30 am - 5:00 pm                                                                                Wed                    11:30 am - 5:00 pm                                                                Thu                    11:30 am - 5:00 pm                                                                Fri                    11:30 am - 5:00 pm                                                                Sat                    11:30 am - 5:00 pm                                                                Sun                    11:30 am - 5:00 pm", "tele": "(415) 606-9349", "address": "496 Beach StSan Francisco, CA 94133", "imageList": ["https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_GaWQnYnc1cDwO-kzHTnSA/ls.jpg", "0a3659e53fdde02c482b9410d218895c.jpg"], "type": "British,\n                    Fish & Chips,\n                    Seafood"}
{"title": "div itemprop=\"review\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Review\">\n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        I&#39;ve only had Humphry&#39;s once while I visited SF but I can honestly say that it&#39;s one of the best ice cream places I&#39;ve been to. \n\nSecret Breakfast: a combination of bourbon and cornflakes. Bourbon wasn&#39;t too overpowering and complimented the milky ice cream really well along with the slight crunch of the cornflakes\n\nThe Duet (i think is available seasonally) featured their Tahitian V*n!ll@ with limoncello sorbet and biscotti. It was really good! The sorbet and milky ice cream actually paired really well together \n\nBlue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee was really strong and good. Tasted like Lee&#39;s Vietnamese iced coffee to me. \n\nThe only downside was the price but I&#39;d gladly spend the money for great ice cream!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        West Coast is just spoiled with all these artisan ice cream parlors aren&#39;t we? It&#39;s pretty difficult to decide on a flavor but eventually I narrowed it down to two.\n\nSecret breakfast - What&#39;s the secret? You&#39;ve gotta be above drinking age. There&#39;s a bit of rum in it but it&#39;s mashed with cereal.\n\nBaker&#39;s wife - Cookie mashed vanilla base ice cream. \n\nBoth flavors were pretty similar in taste. \n\nWorth checking out if you&#39;re looking for unique invented flavors.\n\nCheck back often because they rotate flavors according to the season. I heard foie gras ice cream is back in August!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Cute, small spot. To be honest though, we prefer having it delivered to our home. Secret Breakfast, the perfect blend of bourbon and cornflakes, is our favorite. Dark Chocolate Smoked Sea Salt, is a close second.\n\nThere are no words I can offer, to do this ice cream justice. Creamy, silky, party in ya&#39; mouth, break yo&#39; mouth, don&#39;t even come close to capturing it&#39;s explicit level of greatness. \n\nMama gonna go have some now. Buh-bye.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Very unique flavors, but hella pricey. I encourage you to sample the flavors before you make a decision. The Secret Breakfast is popular, but I didn&#39;t think it was all that.\n\nThey also have limited time offers, like the Coffee Ice Cream and Chocolate Cookie Sammie that I got ;)\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        My math skills may not be too polished. But I do know for $8.50 I get:\n\nA can of whoop ass can of Blue Bottle cold brew + a scoop of Tahitian Vanilla + a warm drizzle of chocolate syrup= \n\nA Blue Bottle iced brew float that adds sweetness and ultimate caffeine in your system rapidly.\n\nHallelujah!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        First time trying this ice-cream spot and it was so delicious! Creamy, light, and refreshing! I ordered the double scoop of ACT&#39;s golden milk: honey tumeric, ginger and Matchadoodle: green tea ice cream with snickerdoodle cookies. So good!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Good ice cream and unique flavours, but needs more selection! There was plenty of icecream in each scoop as well.\n\nWhen you go, get the Vietnamese coffee icecream and the thyme and honey! I liked the thyme flavour because it is unique and something you can&#39;t find anywhere else.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Humphry Slocombe still has some of the most solid selection of ice cream flavor combos in the city. I&#39;ve never checked out this location before but since it was rainy and cloudy yesterday, I of course needed to get some ice cream and Humphry Slocombe was right there to answer my cravings!\n\nThis location has it&#39;s own seating (6 seats at a counter) and restroom which is a plus. Since it was beer week I got the Mango Sour and a Rye beer flavor. Neither flavor was as strong as the beer flavors from last year but still very tasty. The mango sour was a little sour with a kick of salt. It was a nice pairing with the Rye beer that was a bit sweeter almost chocolatey w/ almost a grain aftertaste (not in texture). They were both delicious. The only reason I knocked off a star is cause the texture was pretty bad. Not inedible bad but definitely nowhere near the creamy, smooth ice cream I was hoping for.\n\nOverall, I still adore Humphry Slocombe. Their flavor choices are still one of the best in the city.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        San Francisco is famous for its small, innovative ice cream shops like Bi-Rite, Mitchell&#39;s, and Smitten. Humphry Slocombe falls into the same category as these places, but unfortunately falls short in a few regards.\n\nLet&#39;s start with the good. They have a wonderful rotating selection of some unique flavors, including sesame, cinnamon tres leches, vietnamese blue bottle coffee, dirty chai, tahitian vanilla and more. You&#39;re free to sample as many as you&#39;d like.\n\nOne scoop will run you $4.50, which I have a hard time swallowing no matter how good ice cream is. Compare this with similar ice cream shops in the area and you&#39;ll find that Humphry Slocombe is one of the most pricy, if not the most expensive outright. Furthermore, the service is incredibly slow when the line gets long. I&#39;ve seen longer lines at Bi-Rite move much more quickly than shorter ones here. \n\nWhile the flavors here are certainly nice, I&#39;d prefer to stop by nearby Xanath, Mitchell&#39;s, or Bi-Rite for more selection and more bang for my buck.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Great ice cream spot with specialty flavors. Would definitely go again if I&#39;m in the area. My two daughters loved the malt chocolate flavor (they split a scoop out of a cup) and I had the Peanut Butter Fudge Ripple (out of a waffle cone). Can&#39;t go wrong with either selection. A bit on the pricier side especially for being in the Mission district. $9 for the two scoops.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        I sampled the malted milk chocolate, the peanut butter ripple, and kumquat poppyseed. Malted milk chocolate had a really malty-sweet base with chocolate as the second strongest flavor, and the peanut butter ripple didn&#39;t taste that unique to me (mostly vanilla and cold peanut butter-y chunks). I didn&#39;t really like the kumquat poppyseed but I wanted something not too sweet or plain. \n\nI realized after a few bites that there was a strong salty aftertaste and after that aftertaste there was the nutty poppyseed taste. WEIRD. Maybe my tastebuds were numb but I didn&#39;t taste any kumquat so I was disappointed. Good serving size and melting rate though.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        I love ice cream, so we decided to check out this place after already having ice cream at another place just minutes before. This shop has fewer flavors, so it was less overwhelming to choose from. Some of the names of the flavors aren&#39;t straightforward, so you&#39;ll have to ask what&#39;s in it and sample them all LOL. \n\nI like that they have some unique and weird flavors too. Some of the interesting flavors they had on that day were secret breakfast, carrot mango, salted black licorice, and fluffer nutter. I usually don&#39;t go for coffee flavored ice cream, but I really liked the taste of the Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee. The texture was really creamy, rich, and smooth. Out of the two ice cream places I tried, I think this one was a little better.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        I am so in love with their Vietnamese Blue Bottle Coffee flavor! It&#39;s not too bitter, and has the right amount of creaminess. I really like pairing this with their Harvey&#39;s Milk flavor, which is more on the sweeter side. Perfect combo! \n\nI have also tried their Secret Breakfast flavor as well and thought the bourbon taste was way too strong. After a few licks, the alcohol taste became too overwhelming for me and I wasn&#39;t able to finish my scoop ): Felt like I needed a chaser haha.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        YUM! \n\nI&#39;m a huge fan of ice cream so i&#39;ve been wanting to try this place for a while and sure wasn&#39;t disappointed. \n\nService: Very quick service and they let you sample as many flavors as you&#39;d like. \n\nWhat to get: Secret Breakfast &amp; Tahitian Vanilla in a cone! I was a little skeptical about the secret breakfast flavor at first but it sure didn&#39;t disappoint. Pair that with your not so plain old vanilla and BAM a taste sensation. \n\nAll in all, Humphry&#39;s does a great job of incorporating new flavors while adding a twist to the classics. Definitely will come back to try other flavors!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Decided to go here on a whim just because of the different flavors that they have on their website and I was not disappointed at all. Went on a Monday night so there were plenty of street parking. \n\nThe workers are really friendly there. I pretty much sampled all the flavors that they had out. I was hoping to try the sorbet flavors but there weren&#39;t any out, oh well. The ice cream is really creamy and they had some pretty different flavors. The most popular one is Secret Breakfast. I actually ended up buying a pint of White Chocolate Lavender (10$) and the Double Happiness Ice Cream Sandwich (5.50$). \n\nI would rather get a pint of ice cream just because a scoop is gonna cost you $4.50. \n\nHonestly, the ice cream sandwich is BOMBBBB. The oolong tea ice cream was really subtle and the gingersnap cookie was so soft and moist. Probably one of the best ice cream sandwich/cookie I have had so far.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        I just came here today because my friend took me out here and I had dulce de leche ice cream and it&#39;s soooooo good, I highly recommend this place if you&#39;re in the neighborhood, lines can be a little long but move fast.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Bi-rite, be damned - I think Humphry Slocombe is the best ice cream in SF (I do reserve the right to change my mind though). Although some of their ice creams have crazy names and seemingly crazy flavors, they do what they do well and their flavors will resonate with both hipster and non-hipster palates alike. \n\nMy husband hates driving in the city - the parking, the lines, the high concentration of people, but we&#39;re always wiling to make the trek for Humphy Slocombe. My go-to fave is the Secret Breakfast that everyone knows and raves about, but the Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee and Harvey Milk and Honey Graham are a few recent faves. Lines go by quick enough and there is some seating indoors and outdoors. Lazy? It looks like you can have your ice cream delivered by Postmates or you can pick up a pre-packed pint. \n\nPRO TIP - be efficient with your money and treat yo&#39; self to 3 delicious scoops in a bowl to share.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        This is one of the most interesting ice cream spots in the city.  At first glance the flavours can be kind of WTF but at first taste it&#39;s all about yum. \n\nOnly issue for me: some of the flavors are a little too sweet.  No problem though, since they let you sample as much as you want before you take the plunge. \n\nStop thinking about it. Trust me, you should just go.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        When in SF, try as many ice cream shops as possible! I came here one day with my Dad while running errands in SF and recommended we get ice cream at Humphry&#39;s. He&#39;s a foodie like me so it&#39;s always fun taking him on a food adventure! After sampling many of their flavors I decided to get a scoop of their Secret Breakfast (I believe it&#39;s their most well known flavor). I don&#39;t really remember which flavor my dad got but it was one of their alcohol infused ones. I remember him enjoying it quite a bit. \n\nThe server was super friendly and patient with us as we asked to sample different flavors. I would definitely come back to try more of their flavors since they seem to change every so often. I really enjoy and appreciate the more &#34;adult&#34; flavors because while yes Cookie n&#39; Cream and Mint Chip are yummy, it&#39;s fun to be adventurous at times and try special artisan ice cream shops. Can&#39;t wait for my next visit! \n.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Small ice cream store with interesting flavors. The flavor names were all creative but most didn&#39;t give too much of a clue as to how it tasted. I guess that&#39;s what sampling is for! I&#39;m very adventurous when it comes to food and ice cream flavors and so I enjoyed tasting the flavors they offer here. Their flavors are not basic and different from your original ice cream. I believe I even tried one with bacon in it. After trying a few, I settled on the oolong flavor. Really sweet and tasted just like tea! I liked it a lot.

{"title": "div itemprop=\"review\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Review\">\n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        OK, iit&#39;s expensive. Probably the most expensive I have eaten at for a couple of years, but hey! Don&#39;t have money when you got a start-up, we&#39;ve really had to pull in our horns, but instead of $300 for a full multi-course dinner with wine pairings, we can eat as little as we want between $10 and $30 a plate and share.\n\nThis is really a place for a culinary adventure. The flavors are going to rock you, with combinations you have never and seen and which actually work! (mostly) Some of the menu is printed, the rest is presented dim sum style by wandering servers with large platters featuring prominent prices. (Dim sum literally means small thing, so it makes no literal sense to present &#34;small plates in small thing style&#34;, but hey, I&#39;m not a marketer, what do I know? I got it when I saw it.)\n\nWhat we had:\nSpanish octopus: da bomb\n\ndaikon fries: original, great crunch. Lack of flavor is daikon&#39;s primary inherent problem, maybe try a watermelon radish or something a little more pungent? But I found myself reaching over the table for another, so it must have been good.\n\nSmoked liver mousse: best damn mousse I have eaten. EVER. Period. Monster emoji. \n\nThe state Bird is a recurrent staple. Fried Cornish hen was Yum. I almost broke out in a Cornish accent. Oh wait, it was quail. Sometimes, it&#39;s hard to tell what bird it is when it is one of these tiny ones, but the crunch made it worthwhile anyway.\n\nDumpling in sweet and sour broth: Heaven. I drank the broth.\n\nBraised pork ribs are brilliant. \n\nOnly fail of the night was ginger ale granita that was a little bland outside the frozen ginger and an unpleasant iceberg in the center that just didn&#39;t do it for me. Textural play of the tapioca was amazing but given the ginger, I couldn&#39;t taste the lemon. What a waste of a Meyer.\n\nI want to encourage a chef to get out onto the edge, but not so far as to leave me behind. I was travelling with a friend who had more traditional dining palate but he found enough to eat and not go home hungry, which I was worried about because every plate has some angle to make it unusual and thus suspect in the eyes of some. This place was able to satisfy the palates of  both a foodie explorer and a good ole boy. Everything is brilliantly put together. A couple of items are off the hook. \n\nBottom line, I&#39;m coming back.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Yummy small bites, constantly changing menu, and great service. \n\nI did not have a reservation, instead I waited for their doors to open for a walk-in seat. I waited ~45 mins earlier and was third in line (boba guys and good company made the wait pass quickly). I was seated right away at the counter (which I definitely recommend!!!).\n\nSince we were at the counter, we had the chance to chat up our line cook (i think that&#39;s the proper title) was amazing! Joshua was great at engaging and answering all of my questions. I felt like the experience was so much better because of him. It was great to watch the BTS of the whole operation. \n\nBetween my sister and I, we ordered ~10 dishes. It was definitely enough for us to feel full without bursting at the seams. When asked what we should get, the server mentioned that the toasts/pancakes are must-trys and I definitely agree! We got one toast and one pancake and both were ranked high on my list. I also liked the garlic knotted sour dough bread. It was super savory and had a unique texture. The shot of peanut milk was something I&#39;ve never seen anyone offer before. It would accompany any of the other desserts well. \n\nThough I enjoyed my experience a lot, I think my two criticisms would have to be that the small plates, though little in portion, were extremely heavy. A lot of the items had some kind of fat incorporated into it, delicious for sure but heavy. I would be more mindful to also order some lighter items to balance everything out. Another small critique was on the desserts. It&#39;s a pet peeve of mine when people name things specifically for marketing purpose and I was disappointed by their &#34;bao.&#34; It definitely laid closer to the side of a cream puff, so what I received was different from my expectations. \n\nOverall, I would come back if a friend wanted to try and I&#39;ve waited long enough for the menu to change out more. I completely support this establishment and love their concept!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        I think I&#39;ve found a few fave restaurant in sf!\nI finally got to try SB the other day and I was impressed!\nIf youre a first timer make sure you get in line early if you have no reseys!! Like 4:45ish\nThe &#34;tapas&#34; style is my fave way to eat so SB was perfection\nDefinitaly cant wait to come back\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        I just came to State Bird with a group of eight and it was a great dining experience! I made a reservation for the Alcove Table almost two months in advance so that is definitely the move if you have a large party. When you reserve for a group this large, they send you a google form where you can write out any dietary restrictions for the group which we all really appreciated. \n\nAlso different was the serving style. State Bird is known for their dim sum style of serving which is so fun and very unique. Reserving the &#34;Alcove Table&#34; means there is a set menu of essentially everything the restaurant has to offer. They make sure there is more than enough for everyone and for my gluten and dairy friend, they made sure there were substitutions specific for her each time there was an issue. Some standouts for me were the duck liver with cornbread biscuits, the State Bird (which was unbelievable), the trout entree as well as the trout avocado chip and dip. While some dishes shined more than others, I enjoyed all of them and there weren&#39;t any that left a bad taste in my mouth...no pun intended\n\nBooking the alcove table took a lot of the stress out of the dim sum experience where the bill can get expensive really fast and it&#39;s hard to know what you want when lots of things are showing up randomly at the table. I would definitely recommend booking this table if you want to come for a group, just plan ahead!\n\nThe table for 8 had a $500 food and drink minimum which is pretty reasonable especially if you don&#39;t order wine. They price everything out for you in advance so you don&#39;t have to think about anything. It was an exceptional experience and I&#39;m looking forward to coming back!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        I had this place bookmarked for awhile.  When walking in at 7:30pm asking if we can get a table and was told the next available table would be 9pm but got lucky that a few table of 2 were flying by their dinner that we got a table within 20mins.  Only caviat was that we would need to give up our table at 9:15pm which was never the case.  The host came by a few mins before and told us to take our time, they moved things around to let is continue.  It also could be for two people, the bestie and I had all the specials they had on the &#34;dim sum&#34; style trays walking around and a couple of dishes off the menu.  We were little piggies that night. Lol I think the only reason why we are friends is because of our love for good food. \n\nAnyways the restaurant is quite small but very open. The concept is similar to the Asian dim sum style restaurant where food is rolled around in carts and tray except this is not the Asian style dim sum food. These are the specials off menu dishes from the chef that night with price tags next to them and are always served fresh so nothing is cold.  \n\nService was fantastic from the host, our waitress, and the people with the off menu dishes.  \n\nWe had a lot of dishes which I captured all on camera of my faves and non faves.  I will only list my fave and my least fave. :)\n\nFavorites:\nSpot prawns steamed in this delicious sauce I forget (5/5): One of my top fave of the night. They have it occasionally and it was delicious.\n\nDuck liver pate with mini corn bread (5/5) simple yet complex, it was delicious.  I literally wanted to clean the last bit of that duck liver pate. Definitely a fave.\n\nSpanish style octopus (4/5) light and refreshing. The flavors went well.\n\nFried quail (half order from menu) (4/5) portion is small but mMmmm it was fried on point and tender. Loved the flavors.\n\nLeast favorites:\nDuck confit fried rice (from menu) (2/5) it was one of my least fave. Overly salty.\n\nChocolate torte with meringue (from menu) (1/5) we both didnt like this at all and could not finish after one bite.\n\nGarlic bread with burrata cheese (1/5): very disappointing. Never had any dish with burrata cheese that i did not like but this was just bland and flavors did not blend well for me.\n\nOverall i would definitely come back for a special occasion.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        OH MY LORD! State Bird Provisions is definitely my top 5 restaurants in SF!! I went with a group of 9 people and it&#39;s provides a full tasting menu. It includes 4 different sections with about 4-5 dishes each which also includes desserts. I highly recommend getting a reservation but if not, you can line up at the door (before they open) and do walk-ins unless you want to wait hours. \n\nLove the environment and the service was great! If you&#39;re not doing the full tasting menu, the concept is pretty much a dim sum style. Anything you choose is delicious and you wont be disappointed. I will definitely come back here again!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        If your ever in San Francisco, State Bird Provisions is a great foodie place to come to! \n\nYou get to sample interesting flavor profile dishes and the dim sum style approach really make it so much special. \nThe most stunning dish of the night was the grilled octopus, poke and oysters! \n\nThe grilled octopus was cooked to a tea and the sauce that went with it was simply earthy and fatty which cut the citrusy charred octopus; making it very memorable. I wanted more of that octopus but I had to save my stomach!\n\nNow, the poke was exceptional. I could eat the whole bowl of poke by myself if they&#39;d let me. It was just so addicting and the marinade was so subtle yet herby in a way; which I really appreciated. They really knew how to marinade it! The poke came with these type of veggie thin sheets crackers which complemented it very well. \n\nThe oysters were also quite outstanding! Very clean and the sauce and accommodates they added to the oyster really brought a subtle sweetness and earthy flavor to it. \n \nWhat surprisingly wasn&#39;t good at all was the hen dumpling.  Like this was so disappointing! I feel like the soup it was served in wasn&#39;t the right flavor profile at all it was citrusy and the hen dumpling didn&#39;t complement it at all. They should take this out or improve it. \n\nOverall this is a solid place to go to! When in San Fran come here for sure for interesting dishes and great ambiance!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        I have been pushing off writing a review for this restaurant because of the effort it was going to take. I mean I&#39;m not going to say things that haven&#39;t been said before, but it still deserves a worthy review. \n\nI had the pleasure of experiencing this restaurant with my friend who was visiting from out of town and happens to be a former chef and current food scientist. Shout out to Davis J. It was so cool to listen to his thoughts and conversations with one of the chefs. We sat at bar seating right in front of the food prep and cook! \n\nWe definitely had many favorites and I can only think one dish that I felt meh about. It was the beef tartare. Portion size way too big and kind of lackluster in flavor. The rest of the dishes were top notch.\n\nI have forgotten the name of the dishes, but will do my best to describe them. \n\n- savory oysters with sesame - spectacular. The problem is pacing yourself and not getting like a million of the things you really like because there will be more flavors and dishes and you.. JUST PACE YOURSELF.\n- some butternut squash dish with pomegranate and feta - awesome \n- pork belly - must not skip. one of my favorites\n- pork wonton in broth - that broth. gahhhh.\n- buratta in the sourdough bread, so rich and yummy. \n- tostini with mushroom and blue cheese spread (I think it was blue cheese, my memory is failing me)\n- a shot of this AMAZING savory custard. \n\nI know I&#39;m forgetting some other dishes we had. \n\nSo, the thing about State Bird is that you&#39;ve got to appreciate all the various textures. Each dish is so different from the next and they all feel so different in your mouth. Soft, crunchy, creamy, chewy, wet, dry. All of it.  \n\nThere are SO many culinary techniques used to make each dish and they have to get it perfect to make you experience it the way you do. I am not so familiar with haute cuisine, so this was a huge treat for me. \n\nI was incredibly happy and proud to have dined here. The weekend I went was a sad weekend for America (inauguration of new president). State Bird Provisions donated a portion of their profits from the weekend to the National Network for Immigration and Refugee Rights and the ACLU. TAKE ALL OF MY MONEY STATE BIRD. TAKE ALL OF IT.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        On my brief trip to San Francisco, State Bird Provisions was one of the most highly recommended restaurants that came to me, so despite the fact that the best I could get was a 9PM reservation (made almost a month in advance!), I was determined to make it there for a meal.\n\nThe restaurant is located on a well-traversed street right by SF&#39;s Japantown. Perhaps not the most intuitive location, but it also meant that parking was relatively easy to find and a number of other places nearby were still open. Upon getting greeted and checked in, we were quickly seated in the dining room. Our server ran through the dining format with us, which is pretty unique; in addition to the standard items listed on the printed menus, there&#39;s a number of plates brought out on trays and trolleys by servers dim sum-style; if you agree to order one, it&#39;ll simply be marked off on your menu as an addition to your order.\n\nAs a whole, the format worked pretty well as dishes were brought out regularly throughout the evening. From the off-menu items, we enjoyed a creamy Burrata served with garlic bread, a modern interpretation of chips &amp; dip featuring house-made Chips and a Smoked Trout-Avocado dip, as well as a well-balanced salad that paired citrus (orange and grapefruit slices) with several chunks of crisp and fatty deep fried pork belly. The table favorite was definitely the first one we opted for, however, which featured braised, fall-off-the-fork tender pork ribs stewed in a rich black bean and black garlic sauce.\n\nIn hindsight, I&#39;m tempted to say the a la carte items weren&#39;t as strong. The Black Trumpet Mushroom &amp; Meyer Lemon-Goat Cheese toast was a smart pairing, as it contrasted earthy mushrooms with the acidity and of lemon and the creaminess of goat cheese well, but it&#39;s also a familiar combination. The signature CA State Bird with Provisions plate wasn&#39;t as impressive as we&#39;d hoped either; there was very little actual protein given the leanness of the quail, and aside from a few shavings of parmesan and a handful of sliced onions, there wasn&#39;t much else to the dish. Our table did, however, enjoy the Allium Fried Rice, which was served a la plancha and had diced ham and spiced shrimp intersperse throughout the dish; the texture of the rice was surprisingly toothsome and the overall flavor and seasoning was spot-on as well.\n\nAs a whole, I commend SBP for continuing to innovate their menu and staying true to their  vision of serving modern Californian cuisine with noticeable Asian influences. It&#39;s an ideal restaurant to go with a group to, as the format and size of dishes are best for sharing, and the ambiance encourages lingering over the final few plates or a glass of wine.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        I&#39;m sure I won&#39;t be saying anything new about State Bird Provisions that hasn&#39;t been already said. \n\nService &amp; atmosphere: typical upscale hipster vibe with friendly and informative wait staff. Food was brought around in a steady pace with our ordered food arriving quickly. \n\nFood: I can&#39;t even remember everything that my party of 5 ordered. We got multiple toasts and as many dim sum as my parents would let me order. The standouts for my group was the fried state bird, pozole, and the sea urchin toast, though pretty much everything was delicious. \n\nWords of caution that you probably already know: it took me forever to come here because of how quick their reservations fill up. Definitely set an alarm for 60 days ahead of when you&#39;re looking to come in and be prepared to be flexible in your times. \n\nSecond, I mean you know what you&#39;re getting into I&#39;m sure. But if my parents weren&#39;t footing the bill, I wouldn&#39;t have been able to afford as many dishes as I would make me even close to full. \n\nAltogether, as long as someone else pays, I&#39;d love to come back and try the remaining plates we didn&#39;t devour.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        State Bird Provisions is a bit overhyped in my opinion. It&#39;s the ultimate FOMO (fear of missing out) experience. Not only is it difficult to snag reservations (make it 60 days in advanced folks!) There&#39;s not a real menu of all the dishes they offer from the carts. \n\nI was able to snag last minute reservations a day before. \n\nA few dishes we ordered:\n\nhog island oyster, kohlrabi kraut &amp; sesame\nCA state bird with provisions\nSteak Tartare\nPork belly &amp; citrus salad\nSmoked duck &#39;tsukemono&#39; with umeboshi-rosemary vinaigrette\nGarlic bread with burrata\nYuzu &#39;ice cream&#39; sandwich\n\nOur bill came out to be around $92 with tax and tip.\n\nNone of the food blew my mind and for what I paid, it&#39;s about the same price as edomae sushi a la carte. The whole concept of provisions is tapas served dim sum style. Think small dishes being passed around by a tray or a cart. The provisions aren&#39;t presented on the menu. I&#39;m not sure how often they rotate but I recommend doing a little research prior to your meal here. One of the servers said you&#39;re better off coming in knowing exactly what you want from the provisions and they can order it for you. Each round of reservations is about an hour long after you&#39;ve been seated. About 14 dishes are passed around. It&#39;s almost like a tasting menu but you can decline or accept any of the dishes offered. There were a few I missed out on (either they didn&#39;t come by my table or they ran out.) The one thing that seemed to go around endlessly were the smoked-trout chips and avocado dip.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Modernized non-asian dim sum. Interesting. By the time I ate, it was 10pm West Coast time when I was still adjusting the East Coast time, so essentially I was eating at 1am, not drunk. I think I would have enjoyed it more if I wasn&#39;t so exhausted and they didn&#39;t delay our reservations by 20 minutes. I will try to be as unbias as possible because overall, if all those factors didn&#39;t come into play, I would have absolutely loved it. But I will have to deduct one star for keeping me waiting an extra 20min on a 9:30 reservation.\n\nYou sit, wait and order when wait staff comes through with plates of freshly prepped food. It was interesting and quite delicious. The consistency of the plates were spot on. The food was more of an Asian fusion. My friends and I tried various dishes (mainly meat dishes because we were ravenous) and execution was good.  I really enjoyed their pork spare ribs, fall off the bone style. The garlic bread burrata was interesting. It kind of had the texture of a funnel cake topped with a peppery seasoning.  I also enjoyed the steak tartar. Freshy and plenty to share between three people. The state bird provision we ordered was the quail. Succulent and a good amount of meat. Nicely crisp skin on the outside and seasoned well.\n\nOverall a unique delicious experience.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Really deserving of the hype, and then some. SBP is a dim sum / tapas-style restaurant, featuring mostly small- to mid-sized dishes that are meant for sharing.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the best way to enjoy SBP is with a large group. This way, we got to try a set menu of 17 dishes in one sitting, most served family-style. It was all $65 per person when we visited (it may be more expensive now), which we thought was a bargain given not only the number of dishes served but also their quality and creativity. Otherwise, you&#39;ll either dine a la carte, or you&#39;ll choose from special offerings carted to your table dim sum style. Either way, there&#39;s a large variety of dishes to choose from at different price points.\n\nMoreover, it&#39;s probably easier to get reservations with a large group. Instead of jumping online at midnight two months prior and trying to snap up any table that&#39;s left, you can contact the restaurant directly and arrange for a large group numbering anywhere from 6 to 16. You&#39;ll sit with your group at a large picnic-style table, and the entire reservation and re-confirmation process is a breeze.\n\nOf the 17 dishes we tried, all were so good, in fact, that it feels like nitpicking to describe which ones were our favorites. The menu started with a course of 6 smaller / appetizer-sized dishes, then moved on to 5 other dishes that were either hearty salads or were slightly heavier in nature, and then featured 4 heavier, meatier dishes before ending with 2 small desserts. \n\nIn the first course of 6, we started some Hog Island oysters seasoned with spicy kohlrabi kraut and sesame. Not only were the oysters fresh, but any &#34;fishiness&#34; was eliminated and, in fact, complemented by the kraut and sesame. Another enjoyably satisfying melange of flavors came with small, individually-sized whole-grain pancakes topped with heirloom tomatoes and Cabot cheddar. Similarly, chopped cucumbers topped with kinako and black sesame felt quite nourishing going down. A &#34;chip and dip&#34; course that came with horseradish creme fraiche topped with Coho salmon roe was at once salty, tangy, and roe-y. Yet again, all these flavors worked well with each other instead of clashing. Then, some duck liver mousse served with almond biscuits was sinfully satisfying. I often brace myself for a horrible, excessive, liver-y taste when I see &#34;liver&#34; on a menu, but this was so well executed I could have eaten the entire chunk of mousse on its own off the plank. Nevertheless, the almond biscuits were fantastically complementary with the mousse.\n\nThe next course of 5 started with some garlic bread with burrata; while seemingly simple on the surface, it was deliciously well-executed and was a joy to wolf down. Then came a series of satisfying salads, like a summery one with chanterelle, ham, and fregola, and one with fresh Hawaiian hearts of palm and tahini-chili oil. Particularly memorable was the pork belly pluot salad, with the pork belly fried so perfectly that it tasted like Chinese crispy roasted meats you&#39;ll see hanging from butcher shop rotisseries and window displays in Chinatown - but *even* better. Next, a cast-iron dish of quail eggs with cucumbers and goat milk queso fresco left us all moaning approvingly in our umpteenth foodgasm of the night. \n\nThe fun continued with the next series of 4 heavier dishes. The namesake California state bird with provisions (really fried quail) was fried perfectly and simply delightful going down. The next dish turned something as supposedly simple as fried rice into a real culinary statement with the benefit of kimchi, maitake, and smoked egg bottarga. Two more meaty dishes, the Don Watson&#39;s lamb with cumin, squid, shishitos, and dates, and the red trout with toasted hazelnut-mandarin-garum vinaigrette, helped fill us up further.\n\nThe two desserts - fig ice cream with walnut sandies and Asian pear, and a white chocolate-brown butter quince cake with vanilla cream and cocoa syrup - were a delightful way to round out the entire meal and cleanse the palate. \n\nOverall, the atmosphere, ambience, food, and service are top-notch. Everyone in our group couldn&#39;t help noting how lucky we felt to be in a region full of great restaurants that not only source a lot of their food locally, but also draw on global influences and inspirations to take things up a notch. We also felt lucky to be able to share such great food with great company. SBP not only takes things up many notches, but provides you with the perfect setting to create your own special memories with your own good friends - not to mention a great way to mark my 1300th review!\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        I travel to San Francisco about once a year, and I finally got a chance to try State Bird Provisions after being aware of it for more than a year. I have to say that I really like every aspect of it - the dining concept, the food and the service. It deserves all the accolades it gets.\n\nFor my visit, I had:\nHog island oysters withpickled daikon and chili oil - good starter\nSmoked duck with vinaigrette - yum\nFried chicken with kimchi custard - it was ok\nSpanish octopus with vinaigrette - delicious\nDuck confit and wagon wheel cheese croquette - delicious\nOx tail with peanut pozole - it was ok\nchai tea ice cream sandwich - delicious\nblood orange granita with olive oil gelee - did not like this\n\nAlthough I did not absolutely love every dish I ordered, what I do love here is the &#34;dim sum&#34; concept of ordering - the servers bring out little dishes with a little price tag on the tray, and you get to see whether it looks good to you or not. Once you pick something, the server marks it on your sheet. There is also the option of ordering from the menu as well, but the dim sum style is just way more fun, and you also get to try dishes that are not on the menu. \n\nI was excited to know when ordering desserts that half-orders are accepted - so being the greedy hungry person that I am, I ordered two half-order desserts - the chai tea ice cream sandwich and the granita. When I was asked about how dessert was, I informed my server that I did not love the granita (and it was not even half finished). He kindly took that off the bill without any intervention on my part, and I was very impressed with the service.\n\nNeedless to say, I will be visitng SBP again for my next SF visit. Reservations are a must because the place does get packed. As for myself, I managed to do a walk-in for just one person at around 6pm and sat at the chef&#39;s counter without having to wait.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        It&#39;s not often a place so hyped is actually as good as people say but hot damn does this place live up to every expectation I&#39;ve ever been told. \n\nReservations need to be made well in advance but they do leave a fair share of seats for walk-ins. The only caveat is that you need to be lined up by 4:30/4:45 to get a spot. \n\nAs far as the food goes you can&#39;t really go wrong- if you&#39;re not familiar with the concept they serve the majority of their food dim sum style. Wait staff walks around with trays of dishes and you select what you want. There are a few things you can order as well. The only problem with this method is you don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to come out- as soon as you&#39;re stuffed you&#39;ll see a new amazing dish come out of the kitchen. \n\nYou must have the dumplings, the fired sourdough with burrata and the hedgehog toast. I also really enjoyed the beef tartare and pork belly salad. \n\nIt&#39;s also not terribly expensive- our food (we had 9 or 10 dishes) was only about $65.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        I get why people lose it over this place. Eating here is like getting lost in some huge, black forest and finding strange food growing out of the ground.  \n\nWe got a lot, but the three standout dishes were the brussels sprout toast, the state bird fried chicken, and the ice cream sandwiches. The almond cake/biscuit things that came with the duck liver pate were also some of the best things we have ever put in our mouths. Stuff that wasn&#39;t so great: the squash &#34;mochi&#34; and the uni pancakes.\n\nPro tip: I could just not find reservations for this place so, instead, we came here on a weekday night at about 9:30 (they don&#39;t let people sit past 10 pm) and we managed to get a seat without any wait. I strongly recommend trying this rather than doing the 5pm wait-a-thon.\n\nWaiters here are awesome, the dim sum style food is awesome, not too many complaints. I wish I could walk through this dark forest more.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Small plates restaurants are great, because you get to try so many different things in one meal. Half of the menu at State Bird is wheeled around on carts dim sum style, and the other half is ordered from the servers. The concept here was really fun, but it was hard (initially at least) to turn down any of the dishes brought to our table! Overall, I was extremely impressed by some of the dishes we got to try, but others weren&#39;t particularly memorable or worth their price. Nevertheless, the creative menu and wide selection at this restaurant are definitely calling me back to sample more!\n\nWe started with the fry bread with burrata, which had a nice contrast between the chewy bread and the soft burrata cheese. We also had the pork ribs with black bean sauce, the Spanish octopus with a buffalo wing sauce, the crispy pork belly, and the oysters from the  cart servers, and while each of these were good, I didn&#39;t find that any of them stood out in particular. The guinea hen dumpling was delicious--the filling was savory and deep, and the broth it was served in was hearty and warming. \n\nNow to the menu selection. We started with the sea urchin ginger-scallion pancake, which wasn&#39;t particularly great--the sea urchin flavor was a bit overwhelmed by the soy glaze. The Hawaiian heart of palm salad was a refreshing dish, but could have used a bit more flavor and textural contrast. The squash mochi dish was probably my favorite--it consisted of chewy balls of orange &#34;mochi&#34; and was served with Brussels sprouts and maitake mushrooms in a deep, umami sauce that enveloped each of the components of the dish for perfect bites! The dungeness crab kimchi yuba was also really good and creative--the chunks of crab meat were so flavorful, and they were served with sour and spicy kimchi in a broth-like mixture.\n\nThen came dessert (also ordered from the menu). We started with the huckleberry granita, which was overpoweringly sour (it colors your teeth a shade of purple); this dish can probably be skipped. We also had the chai tea ice cream sandwiches, which came in between very chewy ginger-molasses cookies and a delicious fig paste. I also couldn&#39;t resist a shot of the peanut milk, which I really liked--it tasted so much like peanuts, but in liquid form!\n\nOverall, this was a really great experience, and having visited once, I have a much better idea of what dishes I think State Bird does really well. In particularly, I found many of the dim sum &#34;provisions&#34; a little bit underwhelming, but was much more impressed by their menu offerings. I would definitely come back again to try out more of their extremely creative dishes and would highly recommend this restaurant for a unique and fun dining experience.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        This is one of my favourite restaurants in the city. It usually has a long wait on weekends, so what I like to do is show up ~30 minutes before it opens and wait in line, and then either get seated immediately once it opens, or get a table for later in the evening, and go to a bar for a drink or go to the theater nearby.\n\nIn terms of the restaurant itself, it&#39;s small plates, some of which are ordered from a menu, and some of which are wheeled around on carts a la dimsum. \n\nSome of the dishes I really enjoyed:\n- Duck liver mousse with madelines: amazing flavours and very interesting combination\n- Garlic bread with burrata: really, really good\n- Sea urchin, ginger-scallion pancakes (they&#39;re known for their pancakes so make sure to try one if not this one!)\n- state bird with provisions (their signature!)\n- world peace peanut muscovado milk \n\nIt usually costs me $75-100pp excluding drinks depending on how much we order, which I think is a pretty good deal given the quality of food.\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        Exceptional food, need I say more?! This is my third time going to State Bird Provisions and every single time was the best time ever. Food is affordable for a Michelin star restaurant but the quality is top notch. Service is great and the people are friendly. \n\nThe Dim-Sum style of serving food is what makes this place really interesting, but they also have a la carte menu and if you are by yourself you can ask the servers to prepare half a serving of any of their &#34;provisions&#34;. \n\nThey reserve 1/3 of their seats for walk-ins but you have to be there before the restaurant opens just to be sure you&#39;ll get a seat as a long line usually forms up prior to their opening. \n\nSome of my favorites are steak tartare pok\u00e9,  almond cornbread with duck liver mousse, beef tongue pastrami pancake, guinea hen dumpling and of course their signature dish deep fried CA state bird (quail) with onions and shaved Parmesan cheese to name a few. \n\nReally, you can never go wrong with whatever you order. I always walk out of this restaurant feeling happy, stuffed and satisfied!  Just go...\n    \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n        So. Many. Foods.  I tried to photograph them all, but I probably failed.\n\nIt&#39;s Dim Sum style and there is a small Ala carte menu as well. It&#39;s American food but definitely has asian influence.  \n\nThis place is dangerous because they come around with trays of really amazing looking foods and ask &#34;want one?&#34; and it&#39;s hard to say no and all the sudden you have like 7 plates on your table.  \n\nWe&#39;ll start with the best. Their signature dish - CA State Bird with Provisions - definitely took the cake. The Quail was juicy and delicious. The breading was crispy and crunchy (not too oily) the onions on top were soooo sweet and slow cooked in some sort of deliciousness, all topped with fresh parmesan. But really, it all came together perfectly - in the realm of giving food 5 stars, this is a 5.5.\n\nAlso receiving 5 star status: Black trumpet mushroom and Meyer lemon goat cheese toast, beef tartar with sesame and Hamachi Nori Crackers.\n\nThe 4 star winners are: Delicata squash with pomegranate, oysters, chorizo sausages, garlic bread with burrata, ribs (the ribs are probably 4.5 - they were really quite nice).\n\n3 stars (but what would definitely be 4 at other restaurants, but we have to be at least a little critical, right?): Dungeness crab kimchi yuba with with smoked egg bottarga, dumplings, egg nog ice cream sandwich.  \n\nThey have a large wine menu. We got the Lambrusco, because really not that many people have Lambrusco and it&#39;s delicious. We were very impressed because our waiter asked if we&#39;d like if he left the bottle on the table or if he should keep it on ice at the bar (clearly keep it on ice is better). We couldn&#39;t refill our own glasses, but they did in fact keep an eye on us and refill our glasses when they got low.  \n\nIt&#39;s not a cheap place, but it certainly is fun, and I think worth the cash.\n\nOh yeah - reservations. Just buckle down and do it. Go online, see what&#39;s there, make a reservation for 4,5,6, however many weeks out it is, put it on the calendar so you don&#39;t double book yourself, forget about it for a couple weeks, then remember and get excited again, forget again, and then remember and go and have a great time!\n    \n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        \n\n            \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            State Bird Provisions", "url": "/biz/state-bird-provisions-san-francisco", "hours": "Mon                    5:30 pm - 10:00 pm                                                                Tue                    5:30 pm - 10:00 pm                                                                                Wed                    5:30 pm - 10:00 pm                                                                Thu                    5:30 pm - 10:00 pm                                                                Fri                    5:30 pm - 11:00 pm                                                                Sat                    5:30 pm - 11:00 pm                                                                Sun                    5:30 pm - 10:00 pm", "tele": "(415) 795-1272", "address": "1529 Fillmore StSan Francisco, CA 94115", "imageList": ["https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/UfAHw1ko75lbEo2Z5OeeqQ/ls.jpg", "854f66e27b7bad096ba98d814dfe1b21.jpg"], "type": "Tapas/Small Plates,\n                    American (New)"}
